# PR review — verified findings, unambiguous comments

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS` — a PR number or URL (if omitted, run `gh pr list` and ask which one), plus optional `--post` to publish the review to GitHub after composing it.

## Step 1 — Gather

- `gh pr view <n> --json title,body,author,baseRefName,headRefName,state,additions,deletions,changedFiles,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup,url,createdAt`
- `gh pr diff <n>` for the diff; fetch the branch locally: `git fetch origin <base> 'pull/<n>/head:pr-<n>'`
- Check whether the PR is behind its base: `git diff origin/<base>...pr-<n> --stat` vs `git diff origin/<base> pr-<n> --stat` (if they differ, note the drift).
- **Read the existing review conversation before reviewing** — `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>/comments --paginate` (inline threads, with `in_reply_to_id` and author replies) and `gh pr view <n> --json reviews,comments`. A PR is often mid-conversation: a prior round may have raised your finding already, and the author may have replied/fixed it on a newer commit. For each candidate finding, check it against those threads — if it's already open, **reply in that thread** (build on it, or note the sub-point still unaddressed) instead of posting a fresh top-level comment. Duplicating a live thread is exactly the noise that makes review a bottleneck.
- **Verify claimed fixes against the head — "fixed" is a claim, not evidence.** When a prior thread is marked resolved or the author replied "done/fixed", read the current code at that spot rather than trusting the reply. Authors routinely fix the headline of a comment while leaving a sub-point untouched (e.g. "memoized the value" addresses re-querying but not the broad `catch` the same comment flagged). If the fix is real, **leave the thread closed and post nothing** — no reply, no "thanks, that's fixed", no resolved-thread acknowledgment. Silence *is* the confirmation: GitHub already shows the author that their commit addressed the comment, so re-commenting to say so is pure noise, and it is the single most common re-review slop. Only when a flagged sub-point *survives* do you reply in-thread — and that reply carries **only** the surviving sub-point and its fix, never a preamble crediting the parts that were resolved. For a re-review of an updated PR, diff against the commit you last reviewed (`git diff <last-reviewed-sha>..pr-<n>`) to focus on what changed, but still confirm each prior finding is genuinely resolved in the head — and confirm it *silently*, by not commenting.

## Step 2 — Verify, don't just read

Findings must be grounded in evidence, scaled to what the change touches:

- Always read the full files being changed (not just the hunks), and `git grep` the whole tree for symbols/properties the PR renames or removes — silent breakage hides outside the diff (e.g. filtered resources referencing a renamed Maven property).
- Build-config changes (pom.xml, Gradle, CI): build both the base branch and the PR branch in throwaway worktrees (`git worktree add --detach /tmp/<name> <ref>`), then compare: test counts per module, produced and installed artifacts (watch for attached artifacts like `-tests.jar` that downstream consumers depend on), `mvn dependency:tree` diffs, and packaged-archive entry lists plus filtered resources (`unzip -Z1`, `unzip -p ... | diff`). Remove the worktrees afterwards (`git worktree remove --force`).
- Parent-POM or dependency upgrades: download the new parent/dependency POM and confirm that everything deleted locally is actually provided upstream (dependencies vs dependencyManagement, plugin executions, properties, distributionManagement). Check published artifacts on the repository (e.g. `curl -sL .../maven-metadata.xml`) when removal of an attached artifact would break consumers.
- Claims about runtime behavior: run the relevant tests instead of asserting from code.

### Dimensions to sweep

Cover each of these, scaled to what the PR touches — an unnamed dimension is one you'll silently skip: **correctness** (verified, not eyeballed), **test coverage** (section below), **security** (input validation, authorization checks, secrets in diffs or CI config, injection, unsafe deserialization), **performance** (N+1 queries, work added to hot paths or loops, blocking calls, unbounded growth), and **project conventions** (the change should read like the surrounding code — but don't flag what CI formatters already enforce).

### Trace outward — the bugs live outside the diff

The diff is a piece of a bigger machine; review the machine, not the patch. Follow each thread at least one level out from the changed lines:

- **Unchanged neighbors.** Re-read the unchanged code, comments, Javadoc, and docs adjacent to or depending on the change — anything stating an assumption ("the only caller", "X is the only path that…"). Ask of each: does this PR make that statement false? Diff-scoped review structurally cannot catch these, because the now-stale line never appears in the diff.
- **Consumers and published artifacts.** For everything the changed code produces — events fired, attached/published artifacts (e.g. `-tests.jar` classifiers), API responses, filtered resources — identify who consumes it, in-repo and downstream, and verify the contract still holds.
- **Optional dependencies and lifecycle.** For `provided`-scope deps, soft module references (`aware_of_module`), and registration-order-sensitive code (Spring beans, listeners, schedulers), walk through what happens when the dependency is absent or the ordering shifts at runtime.
- **The merged result, not the commit stack.** Review the final combined state of the PR — and re-check it against the current base tip if the branch is behind — rather than commit-by-commit. Individually sensible commits can compose into a contradiction.

### Test coverage is a review dimension

For each behavior change the PR introduces, name the test that exercises it — one that would fail on the base branch, passes on the PR, and asserts the **runtime effect**, not a proxy ("the generated string looks right" or "mirrors an existing pattern" verifies the shape or the sibling, not the behavior). A behavior change with no such test is a finding, even when the code looks obviously correct. If part of the path genuinely can't be tested, name the specific blocked sub-path — and confirm the adjacent runnable path is still exercised.

### Convergence

A pass that surfaced a substantive finding cannot be your last pass: one real find is evidence of unexplored ground, so sweep again until a pass turns up nothing substantive. The converse also holds — don't invent findings to fill a quota; a clean PR earns a short review.

Verify thoroughly — but the evidence belongs *inside the finding it supports*, not in a standalone recap, and a cleared concern usually needs no words at all (see Step 3).

## Step 3 — Compose the review

The review's job is to surface what needs action. Reviewer and author attention is the scarce resource — PR review is a bottleneck, and every line that doesn't change what the author does is pure cost. Lead with action.

Structure of the summary body:

1. Verdict first — **disposition + one headline reason + scope**, nothing else. Disposition is "merge", "merge after X", or "needs work"; the headline is the single biggest reason (point at the finding numbers); scope is the bar you're judging against (e.g. "as a POC none block it; as production code they do"). Don't tour the architecture or grade it ("the design is coherent", "the happy path is plausible") — that's narration-plus-praise the author can't act on. A maintainer scanning the PR should get the call and the one reason in a sentence or two.
2. Findings, each carrying its own evidence (its failure-mode sentence, or the verification that grounds it).
3. End by making explicit what blocks merge — a short list when it's more than one thing, a single sentence when it's one, and nothing when it's nothing. Don't reach for a fixed boilerplate header: a verbatim string like "Needs action before merge:" stamped on every review is itself a bot fingerprint. Say what's left to do the way you'd say it to a colleague.

A "ready to merge" verdict with nothing left to act on is **not** something you post — see Step 4. It goes to the person who asked for the review, in conversation, not as a comment on the PR.

Evidence lives *inside the finding it supports*, not in a standalone "what I verified" section — a real finding is self-justifying once the reader checks it against the code, so a separate verification recap is redundant overhead. **Checked it and it's fine → say nothing.** Do not note cleared concerns "so they aren't re-raised": if the thing is trivially checkable, a later reviewer checks it as fast as you did and your note saves no round; if it isn't, a one-line reply when/if someone actually raises it costs less than pre-empting it on every review.

There is no exception — and on this the body is absolute: verified-clean material never appears in it, not as a section, a bullet, a terse line, or folded into prose. Even when cross-cutting verification was the whole point of the review (e.g. a pom.xml PR's "are the artifacts byte-identical?"), the result is reflected only in the verdict's disposition and the confidence behind it — never written out as a verified-clean note. If such a result genuinely must be on the record, it goes in a single inline `note (no action needed):` anchored to the relevant line, never in the body. On a **re-review** this bans the resolved-finding recap specifically: do not open with "all N points from last round are addressed" or otherwise tally what got fixed. When every prior finding is resolved and nothing new surfaced, there is nothing to post at all: tell the user it's ready to merge in the conversation (Step 4), rather than posting a review body that just announces "merge" — a bot-style "this is ready to merge / LGTM" comment is exactly what makes the author feel they're dealing with a machine instead of a person.

Rules for every inline comment, no exceptions (this is the part PR authors complained about when missing):

- Every inline comment must either request an action or ask a question, and its **first line must make clear what kind of comment it is and what (if anything) the author has to do**. Carry that the way a human reviewer would — in plain language ("This needs fixing before merge — …", "Optional: …", "Is this intended?") — rather than stamping every comment with a taxonomy tag. A column of `issue (blocking):` / `suggestion (non-blocking):` / `nit:` prefixes down the page is itself a bot fingerprint; reach for an explicit label only when the prose doesn't already make the blocking-ness obvious, or when the maintainers have asked for those tags. Whichever form you use, these are the distinctions that must come through:
  - **blocking** — must be fixed before merge
  - **suggestion (non-blocking)** — recommended change the author may decline
  - **question** — a genuine question whose answer affects the verdict. Also use this for uncertainty about an observed side effect ("this changes X — intended?"); a question invites confirmation from people with more context far better than an FYI does.
  - **nit** — trivial, take or leave
  - **note (no action needed)** — exceptional. Allowed only when it does one of these jobs:
    1. records that a behavior change was seen and deliberately accepted, so the audit trail shows it wasn't missed if something breaks later; or
    2. warns a specific future reader at the line they will be looking at (e.g. whoever cuts the next release).
    If it does neither and isn't really a question in disguise, it's narration — don't post it anywhere.
- A blocking comment must contain a concrete failure-mode sentence: **"if merged as-is, X breaks because Y."** If you cannot write that sentence, it is not blocking — downgrade it or drop it. "Low risk" without naming the risk, "matches the existing pattern", "probably fine" are dodges, not verdicts: name what breaks, who notices, and how.
- Silent-failure upgrade: when the failure mode produces wrong behavior without throwing (a swapped repo id, a dropped field, a silently replaced MockMaker), treat it one level more seriously than a crash — CI cannot catch what doesn't throw, so the cost of discovery lands on users.
- When presenting alternatives, always state the recommended default. Never end on "either option is defensible" without picking one.
- Do not narrate what the diff does — the author wrote it.
- Keep each inline comment to its finding and the fix — don't repeat the same cross-cutting point across comments. Verified-clean cross-cutting verification does NOT get relocated to the body (see Step 3 — the body carries none); at most it is a single inline `note (no action needed):`.
- Use GitHub ```suggestion blocks when the fix is a concrete replacement of added lines (RIGHT side only — suggestions cannot attach to deleted lines).
- Scale to the requested effort: by default, fewer high-confidence findings. At high effort, widen the sweep and surface uncertain findings too — explicitly as `question:`, never as unverified `issue`s.
- Fewer, sharper comments beat exhaustive ones.

## Step 4 — Post (only with consent)

Posting publishes under the user's own GitHub account. Post only when the user passed `--post` or explicitly asked; otherwise present the full review in the conversation and offer to post.

**A clean "ready to merge" verdict is reported to the user here, never posted to the PR.** When the review turns up nothing to act on — fresh PR or re-review where every prior finding is resolved — there is no review to publish: tell the user it's ready to merge in the conversation and stop. Do not open a review (even with `--post`) whose body just announces the PR is good to go. Posting "this is ready to merge / LGTM / all looks good now" is the clearest tell that a bot, not a person, is on the other end, and it's the thing PR authors most dislike. Posting still happens normally when there ARE action items — you post those findings; you just never add a standalone merge-readiness flourish.

**Pre-posting gate** — before presenting or posting, write these four as four explicit, standalone lines in your report to the user — verbatim, not paraphrased, not woven into prose narration. If any cannot be said truthfully, go back and fix the review first:

> "Every finding was verified by [building / running / tracing / upstream check], not just read off the diff."

> "Every inline comment's first line makes clear what it is and what the author must do (in plain language, not a stamped-on tag), and either requests an action or asks a question; every blocking comment contains its failure-mode sentence; and no comment — fresh or threaded reply — exists merely to acknowledge a fix or credit resolved work."

> "The summary body is verdict + findings + 'needs action' and nothing else — zero verified-clean or cleared-concern content anywhere in it: no 'what I checked' line, bullet, section, or aside, and none folded into prose — and on a re-review, no 'prior points addressed' recap, since a resolved finding earns silence, not a tally. The verification I did shows up only as the confidence behind the verdict, never written out; if a result must be on the record it is a single inline `note`, not body text."

> "Needs action before merge: [list, or 'none' — and if 'none', this verdict is reported to the user here, not posted to the PR]."

Mechanics that are easy to get wrong:

- Submit one review: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>/reviews --input payload.json` with `"event": "COMMENT"` (never APPROVE or REQUEST_CHANGES unless the user explicitly chose that), a `body`, and a `comments` array.
- Build `payload.json` with `python3` + `json.dump` — raw tabs/newlines in hand-written JSON break the API call.
- Anchoring: `"side": "LEFT"` with line numbers from the **merge-base version** of the file for deleted lines; `"side": "RIGHT"` with line numbers from the **PR-head version** for added/context lines. Get exact numbers via `git show <ref>:<path> | cat -n`. Confirm the merge-base first (`git merge-base origin/<base> pr-<n>`); if it equals the base tip, base-branch line numbers are safe for LEFT.
- Multi-line comments use `start_line`/`start_side` plus `line`/`side`, and the whole span must fall inside a single diff hunk.
- Comments appear under the user's name — write them in first person, collegial tone.
- Threaded replies (Step 1 may send you here to build on an existing thread instead of posting fresh): `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>/comments/<comment_id>/replies -f body=...`. These post as **standalone** review comments — they won't appear in any review payload's `comments` array and carry their own ids, so don't expect them in the main-review verification below.
- Verify after posting — but **trust content, not counts**: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>/comments --paginate --jq '.[] | select(.pull_request_review_id == <id>) | {path, line, side, body}'`. The `--paginate` is mandatory: `gh api` returns 30 comments per page, and a busy PR (a prior round + replies) easily exceeds that, so without it the query gives **false negatives**. Reads can also lag a few seconds behind the write. Diff what comes back against what you submitted by `{path, line}`; if something looks missing, re-query (allowing for lag) and inspect — **never re-post on a mismatch**, that is exactly how duplicate comments get created. If duplicates already exist, delete the extras with `gh api -X DELETE repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/comments/<comment_id>`. Then report the review URL.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't invent concerns to look thorough.** Review depth should track risk; a clean PR gets a short, confident review. Diminishing returns are a real signal, not a failure.
- **Don't post unverified suspicion as an `issue`.** If you couldn't verify it, it's a `question:` — or more homework for you, not the author.
- **Don't critique an inflated version of the PR.** When disagreeing with an approach, respond to the author's actual scope; larger redesigns are follow-up `suggestion`s, not blockers on this PR.
- **Don't let severity labels substitute for analysis.** A finding is blocking because of its written failure mode, not because it pattern-matches "correctness". Small-looking code patterns (an unclosed resource, a swapped identifier) are routinely under-labeled.
- **Don't restore confidence the author already has.** A PR author shipped because they believe the change is right; a recap of what they got right is cost without benefit. The review's value is the delta — what must change, plus the rare verified-clean item a later reviewer would re-raise. Passing CI is not a reason to soften the action items: both the expensive bugs and the bottleneck live in what the tests already wave through.
- **Don't acknowledge fixes (especially on re-review).** A human re-reviewer comments only on what's still wrong — they don't reply "thanks, that's resolved" to every thread the author closed, and they don't open the body tallying what got addressed. Fixed and no remaining problem → no comment; the disposition flip to "merge" is the acknowledgment. Writing the confirmation out feels polite, but it reads as slop and buries the one comment that does still need action. This is the gap authors notice most: the re-review that should have been two lines turns into a wall of "looks good now."
- **Don't let the review read as machine output.** The content rules above are about substance; the *form* matters too, because authors disengage the moment a review smells automated. Two habits give it away even when every finding is sound: a rigid recurring template (verdict header → numbered findings → a verbatim "Needs action before merge:" footer on every PR) and a taxonomy tag stamped on the front of every comment. Write the way a careful human colleague writes — vary the structure to fit the PR, let prose carry blocking-ness, and never post a standalone "ready to merge / LGTM" comment; that verdict goes to the person who asked, in conversation. The goal is a review the author reads as coming from a person who actually looked, not a form a tool filled in.
- **Don't fake confidence on a PR too large to review.** When a PR is too big or sprawling to review with real confidence as one unit, say so plainly and suggest splitting it (by concern, or behavior-change vs. mechanical churn) rather than producing a sweep that reads as thorough but can't be. A reviewer's honest "this exceeds what I can verify in one pass — here's how I'd split it" is worth more than five findings that miss the sixth. Name what you *did* verify and what you couldn't reach.
