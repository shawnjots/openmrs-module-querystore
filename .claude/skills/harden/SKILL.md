description: Run iterative /review and /simplify passes on the current slice in two phases until both converge. Use when the user wants to harden a code slice end-to-end without manually orchestrating the review/simplify dance. Trigger phrases include "harden this", "polish until done", "iterate until convergence", "harden".

# Harden

Iteratively review and polish the current slice in two phases. Phase order matters: review catches structural issues (correctness, missing tests, design concerns); simplify catches polish (duplication, naming, micro-efficiency). Doing simplify on structurally-incomplete code wastes work — review-first surfaces the real fixes before polish happens.

## Phase 1: Structural review (/review style)

Run review passes until structural concerns converge. Each pass:

1. One comprehensive review covering correctness, conventions, performance, tests, security.
2. Apply genuinely actionable findings.
3. Verify with the build (`mvn -pl api install` for Maven, project-equivalent otherwise).
4. Decide: another review pass, or move to Phase 2?

**Stop Phase 1 when ANY are true:**
- The verdict is "ready to commit" / "no further review value."
- Two consecutive passes return only cosmetic items (e.g., test assertion tightening, import ordering).
- The pass starts re-flagging items prior passes addressed.

**Transition gate** (forcing function — say this out loud in the report before moving to Phase 2):

> "Phase 1 stopping condition met: [last pass returned no further review value | last two consecutive passes returned only cosmetic items | last pass started re-flagging prior items]."

If you cannot truthfully complete that sentence, the slice is NOT ready for Phase 2 — run another Phase 1 pass. Two passes both finding substantive issues is a signal to keep going, not stop. Pass count is not the threshold; convergence is.

## Phase 2: Polish (/simplify style)

Run simplify passes until polish opportunities converge. Each pass:

1. Spawn three parallel review agents (reuse, quality, efficiency) over the current diff. After the first pass, brief subsequent passes' agents with the applied and deferred lists from prior passes so they don't re-surface them.
2. Aggregate findings across the three agents.
3. Apply genuinely actionable items; skip stylistic noise and items prior passes addressed.
4. Verify with the build.
5. Decide: another simplify pass, or stop?

**Stop Phase 2 when ANY are true:**
- Two consecutive passes return "nothing actionable" or only sub-noise-floor stylistic items.
- Agents start re-flagging items prior passes addressed (context-drift signal).
- All remaining findings are below the noise floor: micro-optimizations, naming preferences, debatable style.

**Stopping gate** (say this out loud in the final report before declaring `/harden` done):

> "Phase 2 stopping condition met: [last two consecutive passes returned nothing actionable / only sub-noise-floor items | agents re-flagging prior items | all remaining findings below the noise floor]."

If you cannot truthfully complete that sentence, run another Phase 2 pass. Same rule as Phase 1: pass count is not the threshold; convergence is.

## Re-entry

If Phase 2 surfaces a *structural* concern (not polish — e.g., a real correctness bug, a missing test for a critical path, a leaky abstraction), return to Phase 1 for one targeted pass before resuming Phase 2. Don't bounce back and forth more than once.

## Reporting

After stopping, summarize:
- Total passes per phase.
- What was changed across them (one bullet per real fix, separated by phase).
- Why any remaining flagged items were skipped.
- Current build / test status.
- Recommended next action (commit + push, or move on).

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't invent concerns** to justify another pass — diminishing returns are real signals.
- **Don't re-litigate** decisions from prior passes (e.g., "we deferred test fixture unification — should we revisit?" — no, ship).
- **Don't run another pass** if the only items are below the noise floor or the agents start agreeing on "nothing actionable."
- **Don't pause for user input between passes** unless something is genuinely ambiguous. The skill is meant to converge autonomously up to the stopping rules.
- **Don't promote architectural concerns** into in-pass fixes. Items like "this Hibernate proxy hits the DB at backfill scale" are real but belong in the indexer/sync layer, not in the slice being polished — flag and defer.
- **Don't batch-defer "Minor" items by severity label.** Severity labels are an agent's guess, not a verdict. Before deferring any finding, write the concrete failure mode out loud: "if we ship without this, X breaks because Y." If you can't complete that sentence, you don't yet understand the severity — re-read the finding, trace its consequence, and either apply the fix or write down what you'd need to know to defer it. This rule is load-bearing: agents routinely under-label correctness fixes as Minor (e.g. unclosed `AutoCloseable`s, leaked test state) because the code-pattern looks small.

## When NOT to use this skill

- For a brand-new slice that hasn't been reviewed once. Run /review first; promote to /harden only if the slice would benefit from iterative polishing (typical for code that's structurally non-trivial — serializers, parsers, multi-step pipelines).
- When the user wants a single-pass sanity check. Use /review or /simplify for that.
- For changes the user flagged as exploratory or about-to-be-reverted.
