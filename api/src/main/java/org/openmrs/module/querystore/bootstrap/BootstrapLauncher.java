/**
 * Single home for "run the global {@link BootstrapService#bootstrap()} on an OpenMRS daemon thread".
 * Both callers — {@code QueryStoreActivator} autostart and the on-demand reindex REST endpoint
 * ({@code POST /querystore/reindex} with {@code scope:"all"}) — go through here so the daemon-thread
 * launch lives in exactly one place.
 *
 * <p>A {@link DaemonToken} is required: the bootstrap reads global properties for its embedder and
 * backend, which needs the daemon-user {@link org.openmrs.api.context.UserContext} the token sets up
 * on the spawned thread. Until the activator wires the token, {@link #launchAsync()} refuses (returns
 * {@code false}) rather than spawning a context-less thread that would silently misbehave — the
 * caller surfaces that to its own caller (the activator logs and skips; the endpoint returns 503).
 *
 * <p>The token is wired by the activator the same way the bridge dispatcher's is (eagerly from
 * {@code setDaemonToken} and again from {@code started()}), mirroring
 * {@link org.openmrs.module.querystore.bridge.AfterCommitDispatcher}. The {@link DaemonExecutor} seam
 * over the static {@link Daemon#runInDaemonThread} call lets tests verify the launch handoff without
 * spawning a real thread, again mirroring the dispatcher.
