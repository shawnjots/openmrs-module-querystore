 * (bootstrap and bridge alike). The line is grep-able by the {@code [querystore-skip]} token and
 * carries {@code key=value} fields so an operator (or log-shipper) can extract the per-record
 * context — layer, resource type, resource uuid, retryable hint, and the backend's failure
 * message — without parsing prose.
 *
 * <p>This is the deliberately minimal alternative to a durable failures table (see fix #3 scope
 * discussion in the commit history): no schema, no API surface, no automated retry. Operators
 * recovering from a transient backend incident can still locate the affected records by grepping
 * {@code openmrs.log} for {@code [querystore-skip]}, filter by {@code retryable=true}, and feed
 * the resulting uuids back through whatever re-projection path they have available (today: delete
 * the row from {@code querystore_bootstrap_progress} and restart so the next bootstrap re-walks).
