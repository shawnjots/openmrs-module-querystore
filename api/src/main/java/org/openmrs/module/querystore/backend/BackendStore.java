 * Backend SPI for the query store. Implementations live behind {@code querystore.backend} (one of
 * {@code mysql}, {@code lucene}, or {@code elasticsearch} per ADR Decision 3); the service layer
 * depends on this interface, never on a concrete tier.
 *
 * <p>Two invariants every implementation must satisfy regardless of tier:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>resource_uuid-keyed idempotency.</b> The same upsert applied twice produces the same
 *   stored document; the same delete applied twice is a no-op the second time.</li>
 *   <li><b>Patient-scoped read at sub-linear cost.</b> Searches with a
 *   {@link Filter#patientScope(String)} filter must not require a full-corpus scan.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Write semantics: every {@code upsert}/{@code delete}/{@code bulk*} call returns only after
 * the backend has acknowledged durability AND a subsequent search from the same JVM will see the
 * write. The SPI does not expose transaction handles; "the write succeeded" means durable +
 * visible.

	 * full-chart-to-LLM consumer path that needs the patient's entire indexed projection without
	 * relevance ranking or result-count limits. Honors the second SPI invariant: the patient_uuid
	 * filter must push down to the inverted index / FULLTEXT / term filter so the work is bounded
	 * by the patient's document count, not by corpus size.
	 *
	 * <p>Returns an empty list when no per-type stores exist yet, when nothing is indexed for the
	 * patient, or when {@code patientUuid} is null/blank — callers (the service layer) probe with
	 * {@code existsByPatient} first and trigger lazy bootstrap on a true cold start, so an empty
	 * return here means the bootstrap also produced nothing, which is a steady-state outcome.
	 *
	 * <p>Error tolerance is tier-shape-dependent but every implementation honours the "don't throw"
	 * contract: failures are logged, an empty or partial chart is returned, and the LLM caller is
	 * never left mid-prompt with a thrown call. Two shapes are recognised:
	 * <ul>
	 *   <li><b>Per-store partial</b> (MySQL, Lucene) — implementations enumerate per table / index;
	 *   one store failing drops that store's contribution and the rest still appear in the chart.
	 *   This is the preferred shape when the backend's read model has natural per-store
	 *   boundaries.</li>
	 *   <li><b>Call-level all-or-nothing</b> (Elasticsearch) — implementations issue a single
	 *   cross-index search; a call-level failure (cluster red, connection lost) yields an empty
	 *   chart for the whole call. Per-shard failures inside a successful response are absorbed into
	 *   the returned hits silently. The cost of partial fallback (per-index serial searches) is not
	 *   justified at the ES tier in v1, where the wildcard search is the operational hot path.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * Callers must not interpret an empty list as "patient has no chart" without consulting
	 * {@link #existsByPatient(String)} or accepting that v1 collapses both states to {@code []}.
	 *
	 * <p><b>Cross-call consistency.</b> Each implementation chooses its own snapshot model — the
	 * SPI does not promise referential integrity between documents within a single call's result.
	 * Specifically: MySQL reads all per-type tables in a single JDBC transaction (one read-view
	 * across types); Lucene opens a fresh NRT {@code DirectoryReader} per index inside the loop,
	 * so writes landing between two index iterations can appear in the later index but not the
	 * earlier one; Elasticsearch's wildcard search is shard-snapshot consistent at the search time.
	 * Consumers assembling LLM prompts from a chart with cross-document references (e.g. an obs's
	 * encounter pointer) must tolerate the referenced doc being absent in the same result; the
	 * three shapes converge to "everything indexed at some moment around the call," not "everything
	 * indexed at one atomic instant."
	 *
	 * <p><b>Mid-purge race.</b> A {@link #bulkDeleteByPatient(String)} call interleaved with an
	 * in-flight {@code findAllByPatient(patientUuid)} for the same patient can return a partial
	 * chart on the per-store-partial tiers (MySQL is protected by its single transaction; Lucene
	 * straddles the purge across per-index iterations; ES depends on shard-level timing). The
	 * returned partial chart contains real but stale records for a patient mid-purge — operationally
	 * significant when the purge is privacy-driven. Callers initiating a purge should not assume
	 * concurrent reads have already drained.
