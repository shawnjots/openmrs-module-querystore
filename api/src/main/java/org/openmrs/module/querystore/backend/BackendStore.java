/**
 * Backend SPI for the query store. Implementations live behind {@code querystore.backend} (one of
 * {@code mysql}, {@code lucene}, or {@code elasticsearch} per ADR Decision 3); the service layer
 * depends on this interface, never on a concrete tier.
 *
 * <p>Two invariants every implementation must satisfy regardless of tier:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>resource_uuid-keyed idempotency.</b> The same upsert applied twice produces the same
 *   stored document; the same delete applied twice is a no-op the second time.</li>
 *   <li><b>Patient-scoped read at sub-linear cost.</b> Searches with a
 *   {@link Filter#patientScope(String)} filter must not require a full-corpus scan.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Write semantics: every {@code upsert}/{@code delete}/{@code bulk*} call returns only after
 * the backend has acknowledged durability AND a subsequent search from the same JVM will see the
 * write. The SPI does not expose transaction handles; "the write succeeded" means durable +
 * visible.
