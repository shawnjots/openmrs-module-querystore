/**
 * Serializes a {@link ReferralOrder} into a {@link QueryDocument} for the {@code
 * openmrs_referral_order} index. {@code ReferralOrder} is structurally identical to {@code
 * TestOrder} — both extend {@link org.openmrs.ServiceOrder} and add no fields — so the populate
 * logic lives in {@link AbstractServiceOrderRecordSerializer}; this class only declares the
 * discriminators that pin the subtype to its {@code openmrs_referral_order} index. The surface
 * actually written today is the Order-base fields plus ServiceOrder's laterality, specimen source,
 * and clinical history. {@code ServiceOrder.frequency}, {@code numberOfRepeats}, and
 * {@code ServiceOrder.location} (the service-location concept, distinct from the encounter's
 * location) are not yet surfaced — tracked under the "ServiceOrder frequency / numberOfRepeats /
 * location surfacing" open question.
