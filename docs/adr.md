# Architecture Decision Records

This document captures the key architectural decisions for the OpenMRS Query Store Module.

## Background

Originating discussion: [RFC: A separate read-optimized projection of OpenMRS clinical data](https://talk.openmrs.org/t/rfc-a-separate-read-optimized-projection-of-openmrs-clinical-data/49397) on OpenMRS Talk.

## Conventions

- **The ADR is in draft.** Decisions can be edited, renumbered, or removed in place while we iterate. The append-only and supersession conventions are suspended until the doc stabilizes (or the first non-trivial implementation lands against it).
- **Open questions are mutable.** Items in the [Open Questions](#open-questions) section are added when surfaced, refined as understanding sharpens, and removed when promoted to a numbered decision (or explicitly declared out of scope).

## Decision 1: CQRS Pattern — Separate Read Store from Transactional Database

### Status
Accepted

### Context
OpenMRS core uses a normalized MySQL database optimized for transactional clinical workflows — recording observations, placing orders, managing patient programs. Consumers such as AI applications, analytics tools, and reporting systems need to query this data in ways that normalized transactional schemas are not designed for: full-text search, semantic similarity search, and embedding-ranked retrieval.

Structured analytical workloads — aggregations, cohort definitions, "missing data" queries, time-series reporting — are a related but distinct query shape, well served in modern OpenMRS deployments by flattened analytical layers like MambaETL where deployed. Querystore's scope is specifically the semantic / free-text / kNN slice. Analytical layers and querystore are co-equal read-side projections of the same transactional source, each optimized for the query shape it is built for; the CQRS rule below applies to both.

Running either workload against the production database risks degrading clinical workflow performance and requires complex queries that fight the normalized schema.

### Decision
Follow the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern. OpenMRS core owns the write side (source of truth). This module maintains a separate, denormalized read-side projection optimized for query workloads.

Data flows one way: from core to the query store. The query store is eventually consistent with the transactional database. Clinical events (obs created, order placed, condition updated, etc.) trigger synchronization via OpenMRS events or AOP.

**Self-sufficiency principle.** For any query pattern the read store claims to serve, it must answer the query without round-tripping to core. Core is permitted only for *content fetches* — binary attachments referenced by `value_complex_uri`, full historical/audit lookups the read store deliberately omits (current state only), or admin/system metadata indexed nowhere by design. Going to core to enrich a read-store result with missing fields, to fall back when a frequent query pattern isn't indexed, or to walk object graphs is a smell: the right response is to denormalize the field, decide whether to index the pattern, or model the graph as multi-hop ES queries — not to silently re-couple to core's transactional database. This rule is the test future open questions are evaluated against.

### Consequences
- Clinical workflows are unaffected by query workloads.
- The query store can be rebuilt from scratch at any time since core remains the source of truth.
- Consumers must tolerate eventual consistency — there is a brief delay between a write in core and its availability in the query store.
- Two systems must be kept in sync, adding operational complexity.
- Consumers gain a predictable contract: clinical and analytical queries are served by the read store; bytes and full audit history are fetched from core. New query patterns force an explicit decision (index it, declare it out of scope, or route to core for content) rather than implicit core fallback.

## Decision 2: Module, Not Core

### Status
Accepted

### Context
The query store could be implemented within openmrs-core or as a separate module.

### Decision
Implement as an OpenMRS module (`openmrs-module-querystore`), not within openmrs-core.

### Rationale
1. **Not every deployment needs it.** Adding query store infrastructure to core would impose unnecessary overhead on every deployment.
2. **Implementation flexibility.** The backing store could be Elasticsearch, a PostgreSQL read replica, or another technology. Core should not be coupled to a specific search/analytics infrastructure choice.
3. **Independent release cycle.** The module can evolve, upgrade dependencies, and ship fixes without waiting for a core release.
4. **Separation of concerns.** Core owns the write side. The query store is a read-side projection — a fundamentally different concern.
5. **Dependency isolation.** Search and analytics client libraries do not belong in core, where they would affect every module and deployment.

Core provides the hook points (events, AOP, service interfaces) that this module listens to for data changes. The module handles everything else.

### Consequences
- The module must depend on core's service interfaces and event system.
- Deployments that want query store capabilities must install an additional module.
- The module can be swapped or removed without affecting core.

## Decision 3: Pluggable Backend SPI with Three Reference Implementations

### Status
Accepted

### Context
The query store needs a backend that supports full-text search (keyword matching), semantic search (vector similarity), structured filtering (by patient, date, concept, etc.), and cross-patient aggregation.

OpenMRS deployments span a wide range of operational profiles. A small rural hospital may run OpenMRS on a single server with limited spare RAM and no infrastructure team to operate a separate search cluster. A large national or research-network deployment may already run Elasticsearch, expects cross-patient analytics over millions of records, and has dedicated operational staff. A single backend choice forces every deployment into the same operational profile — either over-provisioning the small site or under-serving the large one.

Candidate backends considered, with the workloads each handles well:

| Option | Full-text | Vector | Structured filter | Cross-patient scale | Extra infra |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MySQL (reuse core's DB) | Limited (FULLTEXT) | No native support; brute-force in-process | Yes | Per-patient only; cross-patient is O(N) | None |
| Embedded Lucene (in-JVM) | Yes (BM25) | Native HNSW since Lucene 9; brute-force in-process on Lucene 8 — querystore is pinned to 8 to match core's Hibernate Search 6.2.4 (see Consequences) | Limited (point/range) | Single-host only | None new |
| PostgreSQL + pgvector | Yes | Yes | Yes | Good | New database |
| Elasticsearch / OpenSearch | Yes | Yes (dense_vector / knn_vector + RRF) | Yes | Excellent | New service |
| Dedicated vector DB (Pinecone, Milvus, Qdrant) | No/limited | Yes | Limited | Excellent | New service |

The chartsearchai module — querystore's primary near-term consumer — already supports four selectable retrieval pipelines (`embedding | lucene | hybrid | elasticsearch`) backed by MySQL, Lucene, and Elasticsearch in different combinations. Querystore is being designed as a generic read store that can absorb that capability surface without locking deployments into a single tier.

### Decision
The backing store is pluggable via a Java SPI. Querystore depends on the SPI; it does not depend on a specific backend. Three reference implementations ship with the module, and a deployment selects one via an explicit configuration property (`querystore.backend=mysql|lucene|elasticsearch`). Default is `mysql` so that a fresh install adds no new external service or storage beyond core's existing database. (The in-JVM embedding runtime per [Decision 8](#decision-8-locale-specific-serialization-with-multilingual-embeddings) — model file plus inference library — runs across all tiers and is not what "no new infrastructure" refers to.)

| Tier | Backend | Footprint | Trade-offs accepted |
|---|---|---|---|
| Small | **MySQL** — vectors stored as binary in per-type tables inside core's existing database; brute-force in-process kNN; MySQL FULLTEXT for keyword search | No new external service or storage; reuses core's database | Cross-patient kNN is O(N) and not viable above modest scale; FULLTEXT keyword quality is below Lucene/ES BM25 |
| Medium | **Embedded Lucene** — local FSDirectory in the OpenMRS app-data directory; native BM25; brute-force in-process cosine kNN; SPI-default RRF fusion (BackendStore.hybrid default-method) | No new process; local disk only | Single-host; no replication; index loss requires rebuild from core; throughput bounded by one JVM; cross-patient kNN is O(N) — same as the MySQL tier — because the line is pinned to Lucene 8.11.2 (no native HNSW; see Consequences) |
| Large | **Elasticsearch / OpenSearch** — separate cluster; native `dense_vector`/`knn_vector` with HNSW; ES retriever or OS hybrid query for RRF fusion | Cross-server replication, cross-patient analytics at scale, native hybrid retrieval | ~1-2 GB+ baseline RAM for a separate JVM; new operational surface |

The SPI is a Java interface (`org.openmrs.module.querystore.backend.BackendStore`) that abstracts the per-type separation primitive (ES index / Lucene directory / MySQL table — see [Decision 4](#decision-4-per-type-indices-over-a-single-index)), document upsert, document delete, BM25 search, kNN search, hybrid search, bulk operations, and per-type schema/mapping creation.

Three invariants every backend must satisfy regardless of tier are pinned here, because they cross too many other decisions to defer:

1. **`resource_uuid`-keyed idempotency.** The same upsert applied twice produces the same stored document; the same delete applied twice is a no-op the second time. Required by event-handler idempotency under [Decision 12](#decision-12-sync-mechanism--events-first-aop-as-last-resort-gap-filler), where at-least-once delivery means the same event may arrive multiple times.
2. **Patient-scoped read at sub-linear cost.** Queries filtered by `patient_uuid` must not require a full-corpus scan. Required by [Decision 14](#decision-14-authorization-and-consumer-api-surface)'s per-patient query model and by chartsearchai's per-chart latency expectations.
3. **Conditional upsert by `last_modified` version.** An upsert whose `last_modified` is older than the stored document's `last_modified` is dropped; equal or newer applies. When either side has no `last_modified`, the write falls back to last-write-wins. Required because concurrent indexers — the bootstrap scan, the AOP bridge, and the eventual event handlers under [Decision 12](#decision-12-sync-mechanism--events-first-aop-as-last-resort-gap-filler) — can write the same `resource_uuid` in any order, and out-of-order JMS delivery plus variable embedding latency means the race exists even in an events-only world; without this guard, a slow path arriving last would overwrite a fresher document. The MySQL reference backend implements this via `IF(VALUES(last_modified) IS NULL OR last_modified IS NULL OR VALUES(last_modified) >= last_modified, ...)` per mutable column inside `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`. The Lucene and Elasticsearch reference backends are not yet shipped; when they land they will satisfy the same invariant via their respective version-tracking primitives — the specific mechanism is an implementation choice for each backend.

#### Backend SPI contract

The SPI surfaces these operations:

- **Lifecycle.** `ensureSchema(resourceType, spec)` (idempotent, lazy table/index/mapping creation) and `deleteSchema(resourceType)` (full-rebuild support).
- **Writes.** `upsert(QueryDocument)` and `delete(resourceType, resourceUuid)`, both keyed by `resource_uuid` for idempotency. Bulk variants `bulkUpsert`, `bulkDelete`, and `bulkDeleteByPatient` cover backfill ([Initial backfill / bootstrap](#initial-backfill--bootstrap)), void-cascade handling, and patient-merge handling ([Patient merge handling](#patient-merge-handling)).
- **Reads.** `bm25(SearchRequest)` and `knn(SearchRequest)` return separately-ranked result sets; `hybrid(SearchRequest)` is an interface-default method that fuses BM25 + kNN with rank-based RRF in the OpenMRS JVM (see `RankFusion`). Backends inherit the default; the Elasticsearch backend is permitted to override `hybrid` with native RRF when measurable benefit justifies the divergence. The default consults `capabilities().supportsKnn()` and skips `knn()` when the backend declares `false`, so a BM25-only contributed backend (e.g., a PostgreSQL-FTS tier) does not have to override `hybrid` or implement a stub `knn` — it returns BM25 alone. The contract on `capabilities()` is therefore: it must return a non-null `BackendCapabilities` from the first moment `hybrid` (or any other read) can be reached.
- **Filters.** Structured filter pushdown — `Filter.term`, `Filter.in`, `Filter.range`, and the privileged `Filter.patientScope`. The four are first-class `Filter.Kind` enum values (`TERM`, `IN`, `RANGE`, `PATIENT_SCOPE`) rather than distinct primitives, and each backend declares its supported set via `BackendCapabilities.getSupportedFilters()`. All three reference backends declare the full set; module-contributed backends may omit non-`PATIENT_SCOPE` kinds, but `PATIENT_SCOPE` is non-optional — it is the load-bearing primitive for invariant 2 (patient-scoped sub-linear reads) and consumers cannot fall back when it is missing.
- **Patient-scope cold-start probe.** `existsByPatient(patientUuid)` is the lazy-fill discovery primitive: a constant- or near-constant-time "do we have anything for this patient yet" check across every per-type store, used by the auto-index-on-cold-search path to decide whether to bootstrap a patient on demand before serving the query. It is a deliberately narrower contract than a `bm25`/`knn` filtered by `patient_uuid` — implementations are permitted to short-circuit on the first hit and return `false` for both "no documents" and "transient backend error" outcomes, since the caller treats both as "fall through to indexing" (which converges to the same final result either way).
- **Introspection.** `capabilities()` and `health()`.

**Hybrid fusion location: SPI interface default.** All three reference backends inherit `BackendStore.hybrid`'s default-method implementation, which runs RRF (k=60, rank-based) in the OpenMRS JVM so backend-specific score distributions do not leak into the fused result. Native RRF is an opt-in override on the cluster tier — a backend that overrides `hybrid` (and declares `supportsHybridNative` in capabilities) replaces the JVM-side fusion with a tier-native equivalent; uniformity is the default. Tradeoff accepted: a measurable per-query latency penalty on the ES tier versus its native retriever, in exchange for cross-tier parity that the chartsearchai eval workflow can rely on.

**Score semantics: rank is canonical.** `Hit.rank` is 1-based, monotone, and the only cross-backend-comparable signal. `Hit.rawScore` is preserved for telemetry and debugging but is explicitly not comparable across backends or across queries on the same backend. The SPI-default RRF (`RankFusion`) consumes `rank` only.

**Bulk-write success semantics: per-document errors surfaced.** `BulkWriteResult` carries `totalRequested`, `succeeded`, and a list of `DocFailure` (resource type, UUID, error message, retryable flag). Per-document failures are never silently swallowed. The sync pipeline ([Decision 12](#decision-12-sync-mechanism--events-first-aop-as-last-resort-gap-filler)) and reconciliation ([Sync reliability and reconciliation](#sync-reliability-and-reconciliation)) rely on this contract.

**Transactional boundaries: durable + visible after return.** Every `upsert`/`delete`/`bulk*` returns only after the backend has acknowledged durability AND a subsequent search from the same JVM will see the write. The SPI does not expose transaction handles; "the write succeeded" means durable + visible. Backends choose how — MySQL uses a per-call transaction against its own session factory (not enrolled in core's transaction, to keep clinical writes from blocking on read-store writes); Lucene calls `commit()`; Elasticsearch sets `refresh=wait_for`. Throughput-oriented relaxation (e.g., batched ES flushes) is deferred to a future revision under the residual SPI open question.

**Capability negotiation.** `BackendCapabilities` declares `supportsKnn`, `supportsHybridNative`, `supportsCrossPatientKnnAtScale`, `recommendedMaxCorpusSize`, and the supported filter kinds. The service layer reads capabilities before dispatching, logs a warning when an operation is supported but not at the requested scale, and the backend either executes at whatever cost it can or throws `UnsupportedBackendOperationException` for hard misses. Specific corpus-size thresholds and admin-visible alerting policy are deferred to [Tier upgrade operational signals](#tier-upgrade-operational-signals).

**Aggregations are out of v1.** Counts, group-by, and other aggregation primitives are not on the SPI. The chartsearchai migration does not need them; future consumers (FHIR analytics, reporting modules) may surface a need, at which point an `aggregate(...)` method is additive.

**Module-contributed types.** Modules contributing custom resource types per [Decision 13](#decision-13-module-extension-spi-service-provider-interface-for-custom-resource-types) reach the SPI through the same `BackendStore` instance the core types use. They call `ensureSchema(<moduleid>_<type>, spec)` once at module startup and never see the underlying tier; this is what lets the MySQL backend grow new tables without runtime DDL outside `ensureSchema` and without per-module Liquibase changesets.

**Cross-tier structured-field storage: `metadata_json` blob.** All three reference backends store type-specific structured fields as a single JSON blob named `metadata_json`, alongside the cross-cutting columns (`patient_uuid`, `resource_type`, `resource_uuid`, `record_date`, `last_modified`, `text`, `embedding`). The motivation differs by tier but converges on the same shape:

- **MySQL.** Module-contributed resource types must work via `ensureSchema(spec)` without querystore-side Liquibase, and a JSON column means one controlled `CREATE TABLE` per type with zero `ALTER`s as fields are added or contributed. MySQL 8 functional indexes on JSON paths cover hot-field filtering; fields that prove latency-sensitive can be projected into columns later without breaking the SPI.
- **Lucene.** Per-document `StoredField` carries the JSON blob so the backend can rehydrate `QueryDocument.getMetadata()` on read without enumerating every possible field at write time. Doc-value indexed fields (e.g., `patient_uuid`, `record_date`, hot filter keys) are written separately for sub-linear filter pushdown; `metadata_json` is purely the read-side rehydration view.
- **Elasticsearch.** The mapping declares per-field types for hot filter/aggregation fields and one `keyword`-typed `metadata_json` blob for everything else. Without it, mapping explosions on module-contributed types would force a full reindex on every new field; with it, contributors add fields via `putMetadata(...)` and the framework round-trips them through JSON.

The blob's encode/decode helper (`MetadataCodec`) is shared by the three backends so the on-disk shape is uniform regardless of tier. Cross-tier rehydration is therefore a `MetadataCodec.decode(blob)` step that all backends perform identically.

The document model ([Decision 6](#decision-6-document-model--text-embeddings-and-structured-metadata)) is tier-invariant — the same fields are stored regardless of backend. The embedding pipeline ([Decision 8](#decision-8-locale-specific-serialization-with-multilingual-embeddings)) is also tier-invariant — same model, same vectors, same dimensions. Only the storage primitives, index/query throughput, and which advanced query patterns are viable differ across tiers.

PostgreSQL + pgvector and dedicated vector databases are not in the v1 reference set. They may be added later as additional SPI implementations, subject to the contract pinned in this decision being able to accommodate their transactional and query semantics — see the [Backend SPI contract — residual](#backend-spi-contract--residual) open question for the items still open. The three tiers shipped are picked to span the operational range from "no new infrastructure" to "cluster scale" with one clear option each.

### Rationale
1. **Small-deployment fit is a primary requirement, not an afterthought.** Forcing Elasticsearch on a single-server hospital is operationally untenable. The MySQL tier reuses the database that's already running and already backed up.
2. **Capability honesty over uniform pretense.** Making the tier choice explicit, and documenting what each tier omits (cross-patient kNN at scale, FULLTEXT vs BM25 quality, single-host vs replicated), lets deployments choose with eyes open rather than discovering limits at scale. The alternative — pretending all tiers are equivalent — produces silent quality degradation.
3. **Consumers don't need to know.** Per [Decision 14](#decision-14-authorization-and-consumer-api-surface), querystore's public surface is the Java service `QueryStoreService`. Consumers like chartsearchai never see the backend; they go through the same Java API regardless of tier. Backend choice is internal infrastructure.
4. **Leverages chartsearchai's existing backend code paths.** chartsearchai already supports backend selection via a global property, with MySQL, Lucene, and Elasticsearch all in production-tested code paths. Querystore's backend implementations build on those code paths as starting points, though the per-type structure ([Decision 4](#decision-4-per-type-indices-over-a-single-index)), structured-field document model ([Decision 6](#decision-6-document-model--text-embeddings-and-structured-metadata)), and events-first sync ([Decision 12](#decision-12-sync-mechanism--events-first-aop-as-last-resort-gap-filler)) are evolutions beyond chartsearchai's single-table-discriminator + AOP-only design — not direct ports.
5. **Designing pluggability up front is cheaper than retrofitting it.** Once consumer code is written against an ES-specific API, replacing the backend is invasive. An SPI from day one keeps backend choice deferrable indefinitely.
6. **Tier migration is a re-index, not a data migration.** Per [Decision 1](#decision-1-cqrs-pattern--separate-read-store-from-transactional-database), the read store is rebuildable from core. A deployment that outgrows the MySQL tier moves to Lucene or Elasticsearch by changing the config and rebuilding — no data export, no schema migration. Coordinates with the [Re-index / alias strategy](#re-index--alias-strategy) open question.

### Consequences
- chartsearchai's eval workflow ([migration doc](./migration-chartsearchai.md)) was developed against ES-class hybrid retrieval. Running CI evals on the default MySQL tier will report worse recall/precision than production ES sites would see, masking real regressions. Which tier the eval runs against in CI must be picked explicitly when the migration lands; it is not implied by the default backend choice.
- The module ships and maintains three backends. The SPI surface and each backend's correctness must be exercised in CI. Behavioral parity (same query → same result set, modulo score tie-breaking) is part of the test contract; tier-specific capability gaps are explicitly enumerated by `BackendCapabilities`, not silently tolerated.
- Cross-patient kNN scales differently across tiers and degrades smoothly rather than failing hard. MySQL and embedded Lucene are both brute-force in-process — O(N) per query — fine below roughly 100k records, painful past a few million. The Lucene tier wins on keyword quality (native BM25 vs MySQL FULLTEXT) but matches MySQL on kNN capacity. Only the Elasticsearch tier handles cross-patient kNN at multi-million-document scale with cluster-wide replication. The numbers are approximate; deployments should measure their own corpus.
- The Lucene tier is pinned to Lucene 8.11.2 because that is what OpenMRS core ships transitively via Hibernate Search 6.2.4. Bundling a newer Lucene 9.x line collides on the `Codec` ServiceLoader at runtime under OpenMRS standalone — the `lucene87Codec` entry from core's Lucene 8 jars cannot be loaded as a subtype of a Lucene 9 `Codec` class (issue #13). Lucene 8 has no native HNSW kNN (added in Lucene 9.0), so the Lucene tier implements brute-force in-process cosine kNN mirroring the MySQL tier — the inverted index narrows by patient/metadata first, then the scan computes cosine on each survivor's stored embedding bytes. When core moves to Hibernate Search 7.x (Lucene 9.x), the Lucene tier can adopt native HNSW additively.
- Keyword search quality varies by tier. MySQL FULLTEXT is weaker than Lucene/ES BM25 for clinical text (no concept-aware tokenization, weaker term-frequency model). The MySQL tier is functional for keyword search but not optimal.
- BM25 companion channels (synonyms, description, mapping_names) introduced in chartsearchai/docs/adr.md Decision 18 exp 5/7 are indexed on Lucene/ES as separate top-level text fields with per-field boosts — MySQL FULLTEXT cannot match that shape (no per-field boost in `MATCH(col) AGAINST`). A concat-into-one-column workaround — `bm25_corpus = CONCAT_WS(' ', text, synonyms_text, description, mapping_names_text)` with FULLTEXT on the concat — was considered. Empirical investigation on the demo's MySQL backend (2026-05-26) revealed that the deeper blocker is *not* the missing companion channels but two structural issues: (a) obs bootstrap performance — indexing 4119 obs took 3+ hours and was still incomplete at 27%, vs Lucene which finishes minutes after start; (b) hybrid retrieval surfaces duplicate-text vitals-encounter records dominating top-5 even when the BM25 channel would otherwise return relevant Condition/Diagnosis records, suggesting an RRF-fusion or per-table-limit interaction independent of which fields are indexed. The concat-column workaround would not address either failure mode. *Not pursuing the concat column until the bootstrap-throughput and encounter-dominance issues are independently investigated and fixed*; documented here so the next person doesn't repeat the experiment until the prerequisite work is done. The Lucene/ES tiers are the recommended deployments for any installation that needs the companion-channel retrieval quality the BM25 enrichment provides.
- **Bootstrap throughput is bottlenecked by a per-doc commit pattern in the bootstrap loop, not by any backend's storage engine** — diagnosed 2026-05-26 while chasing the MySQL slowness above. The full code path is: `TypeBootstrapper.projectOne` → `service.index(doc)` (single-doc) → `backend.upsert(doc)`, called once per record. Both Lucene's and MySQL's `upsert(doc)` then commit per call: Lucene's `IndexWriter.commit()` creates a new segment file each time (the demo's `querystore_obs` Lucene FSDirectory accumulated 83 segment files for ~1500 records — segment numbers up to `_173` — symptom of per-doc commits driving segment proliferation and downstream merge work), and MySQL's per-doc transaction adds WAL log write + FULLTEXT index update + fsync. Both backends already implement a `bulkUpsert(List<QueryDocument>)` (Lucene at `LuceneBackendStore:179`, MySQL at `MysqlBackendStore:151`) that batches and commits once per batch — but the bootstrap doesn't call it. The fix shape, when this becomes a real-world pain point: add `bulkIndex(List<QueryDocument>)` to the `QueryStoreService` SPI; change `TypeBootstrapper.run()` to accumulate a batch (e.g. ~100 docs), embed each (ONNX call remains per-doc — that's where most wall-clock time actually goes on this hardware, but it parallelises across batches), then call `service.bulkIndex(batch)`; move cursor-checkpointing from per-doc to per-batch, accepting the contract change that a crash mid-batch re-does that batch on resume (acceptable because the freshness-guard upsert is idempotent). Estimated lift: MySQL obs from ~0.1 rec/sec to ~50-100 rec/sec on this hardware; Lucene from ~80 segments per 1500 records to a handful per batch with much less merge overhead. Estimated implementation cost: ~1-2 days including the SPI change, the cursor-semantics contract update, and the test rework (the existing test suite was written against per-doc semantics on all three backends and would need updating). **Not implementing now** — the Lucene-backed demo throughput is acceptable for the current eval workload, and operators choosing the MySQL tier already accept reduced capability per this Decision's tier-honesty framing above. The trigger to implement is a real-world bootstrap-too-slow report on a non-trivial corpus, at which point this diagnosis is the head-start.
- The events-first sync pipeline ([Decision 12](#decision-12-sync-mechanism--events-first-aop-as-last-resort-gap-filler)) writes to the read store through the backend SPI, so sync code is backend-agnostic — switching tiers does not require rewriting event handlers.
- The SPI is part of querystore's *internal* contract. It is not a public extension surface — modules that want to plug in a custom backend can, but querystore does not commit to backward compatibility on the SPI the way it does on the consumer-facing `QueryStoreService` ([Decision 14](#decision-14-authorization-and-consumer-api-surface)).
- The `querystore_<type>` naming convention from [Decision 4](#decision-4-per-type-indices-over-a-single-index) applies uniformly across all three backends.
- Introducing or changing a top-level BM25-indexed field on the Lucene or Elasticsearch tier (e.g., the `synonyms` companion of `text`) is a re-index event for old documents: ES mapping-update accepts the new field but pre-upgrade `_source` documents have nothing in it, and Lucene segments written before the change carry no `synonyms` TextField. Recall on the new field is therefore zero for pre-upgrade docs until they are re-projected. This is a concrete instance of the [Re-index / alias strategy](#re-index--alias-strategy) open question; operators on existing deployments should re-run `BootstrapService.bootstrap()` (after dropping the per-type Lucene FSDirectory / ES index) to recover full recall.
- Operational documentation must cover all three tiers — install steps, sizing guidance, and "when to upgrade tier" signals; the latter is tracked as the [Tier upgrade operational signals](#tier-upgrade-operational-signals) open question.

## Decision 4: Per-Type Indices Over a Single Index

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Data in OpenMRS spans multiple resource types: patients, encounters, visits, observations, conditions, diagnoses, drug orders, test orders, allergies, patient programs, and medication dispenses. These types have different fields and different query patterns. The data can be stored in a single store with a `resource_type` discriminator column/field, or in separate per-type stores.

### Decision
Use per-type stores (e.g., `querystore_obs`, `querystore_condition`, `querystore_drug_order`, etc.) rather than a single mixed store. All names follow `querystore_<resource_type>` — the suffix equals the document's `resource_type` exactly — so the prefix functions as a stable namespace for everything this module produces and routing code can derive the store name from any document mechanically.

The word "index" is used throughout this ADR as the generic term for the per-type separation primitive. It maps to the backend-specific construct under [Decision 3](#decision-3-pluggable-backend-spi-with-three-reference-implementations):

| Backend | "index" means |
|---|---|
| Elasticsearch / OpenSearch | An ES/OS index |
| Embedded Lucene | A separate Lucene `IndexWriter` / FSDirectory per type |
| MySQL | A separate table per type |

The naming convention is identical across all three.

### Rationale
1. **No sparse fields.** Each index contains only the fields relevant to its type. A single mixed store would carry empty drug order fields on every obs document and vice versa, wasting storage and slowing queries at scale. (chartsearchai today uses a single MySQL table `chartsearchai_embedding` with a `resource_type` discriminator and a single `text_content` column — querystore deliberately does not inherit that shape, because per-type structured fields per [Decision 6](#decision-6-document-model--text-embeddings-and-structured-metadata) require per-type schemas.)
2. **Better query performance.** Type-specific queries (e.g., "all patients with HbA1c above 7") only scan the relevant index rather than skipping irrelevant document types.
3. **Better relevance scoring.** BM25 term frequencies are computed per index. Mixing clinical notes, lab results, and drug orders dilutes term frequencies across unrelated document types, hurting search quality. This applies to Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, and Lucene; the MySQL FULLTEXT engine has analogous per-table statistics.
4. **Cross-type search is still easy.** Wildcard patterns (e.g., `querystore_*` in ES/OS, multi-directory readers in Lucene, `UNION ALL` over `querystore_*` tables in MySQL) allow querying across all types when needed, providing the same convenience as a single store.
5. **Future-proof for cross-patient search.** Per-patient chart search works fine with either approach since the patient_uuid filter narrows the scope. Cross-patient search at scale benefits significantly from type-specific indices on backends that support cross-patient kNN at scale (the Elasticsearch tier per [Decision 3](#decision-3-pluggable-backend-spi-with-three-reference-implementations)); the Lucene and MySQL tiers serve cross-patient BM25 and structured queries but not high-volume kNN.

#### Why the `querystore_` prefix
The prefix scopes every store this module manages under a single namespace. This matters for four reasons, each of which applies across all three backends:

- **Namespace sharing.** Elasticsearch clusters are often shared with other applications, or with multiple OpenMRS environments (dev / staging / prod) on the same cluster. Generic names like `obs`, `patient`, or `report` would collide. The same concern applies to the MySQL backend with extra force — querystore tables live in core's existing database alongside core's own tables (`encounter`, `obs`, `patient`, …), which themselves carry no prefix. A `querystore_` prefix unambiguously marks rows as belonging to *this module's read-side projection* rather than to core's transactional schema, where an `openmrs_` prefix would have been redundant against tables that are already "openmrs."
- **Reliable wildcard target.** `querystore_*` matches every index this module produces and nothing else, making it the natural target for cross-type retrieval (the convention promoted by [Decision 13](#decision-13-module-extension-spi-service-provider-interface-for-custom-resource-types)) without having to enumerate names or risk pulling in unrelated indices.
- **Templates and lifecycle policies.** ES/OS index templates apply by name pattern. A single template on `querystore_*` propagates common settings — shard count, replicas, refresh interval, vector-index parameters — to every querystore index, including module-contributed ones. Without the prefix, templates either get broader than intended or have to be maintained per name. The Lucene and MySQL backends apply per-type settings in code rather than via templates, but the same prefix-based addressing makes "all querystore stores" enumerable.
- **Operational visibility.** A DBA scanning the cluster (or the database) sees at a glance which stores belong to querystore — distinct from core's tables on the MySQL backend, and from any other OpenMRS read-side projection that might be added later.

### Consequences
- More stores to manage, though an index template (ES/OS) or shared schema-creation routine (Lucene/MySQL) can share common settings across all `querystore_*` stores.
- Document writes must be routed to the correct store based on resource type. The backend SPI ([Decision 3](#decision-3-pluggable-backend-spi-with-three-reference-implementations)) abstracts this for querystore's service implementation; consumers reach the data through `QueryStoreService` per [Decision 14](#decision-14-authorization-and-consumer-api-surface) and never see the underlying store layout.
- Cross-type queries require backend-specific multi-store syntax (multi-index search in ES/OS, multi-directory reader in Lucene, `UNION ALL` in MySQL). The backend SPI normalises this for the service layer; consumers issue type-agnostic queries against `QueryStoreService` and receive uniform results regardless of tier.

## Decision 5: Plain Text Serialization Over JSON or FHIR

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Clinical records must be serialized into a text representation that is stored in the read store and used for two purposes: (1) as input to embedding models for vector generation, and (2) as content read by LLMs when generating answers. The format options are plain labeled text, JSON, XML, or FHIR JSON.

### Decision
Serialize clinical records as labeled plain text.

Example:
```
Drug order: Metformin 500mg. Dose: 1.0 Tablet(s) Oral twice daily.
Duration: 30 Day(s). Quantity: 60.0 Tablet(s). Action: NEW. Urgency: ROUTINE
```

### Rationale
1. **Token efficiency.** Plain text uses roughly half the tokens of JSON and a third of FHIR JSON for the same clinical content. This matters when assembling multiple records into an LLM context window.

    | Format | Example | Approximate tokens |
    |---|---|---|
    | Plain text | `Condition: Diabetes. Status: ACTIVE` | ~8 |
    | JSON | `{"type":"condition","name":"Diabetes","status":"ACTIVE"}` | ~18 |
    | FHIR JSON | Full FHIR Condition resource | ~30+ |

2. **Better embeddings.** Embedding models are trained on natural language. They produce higher quality vectors from prose-like text than from structured formats with braces, brackets, and delimiters.
3. **LLM-friendly.** Labeled plain text is easy for language models to read and reason over. Field labels (e.g., `Dose:`, `Status:`, `Severity:`) provide sufficient structure without delimiter overhead.
4. **Concepts resolved to names.** Serialized text uses human-readable concept names (e.g., "Fasting blood glucose") rather than concept IDs or codes, improving both embedding quality and LLM comprehension.

### Consequences
- A serializer must be implemented for each clinical resource type.
- The plain text format is less machine-parseable than JSON — consumers that need structured access should use the structured metadata fields in the read-store document, not parse the text.
- Changes to the serialization format require re-embedding and re-indexing affected records.

## Decision 6: Document Model — Text, Embeddings, and Structured Metadata

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Each document in the query store needs to serve multiple purposes: semantic search, keyword search, structured filtering, LLM answer generation, and linking back to the source record in OpenMRS.

### Decision
Each read-store document contains three components:

1. **Text chunk** — the plain text serialization of the clinical record.
2. **Vector embedding** — a dense vector computed from the text chunk, stored in the backend's vector field type (`dense_vector` in Elasticsearch, `knn_vector` in OpenSearch, or raw float32 bytes in a binary field on the Lucene and MySQL tiers — see [Decision 3](#decision-3-pluggable-backend-spi-with-three-reference-implementations)).
3. **Structured metadata** — typed fields for filtering and aggregation (patient_uuid, date, resource_type, resource_uuid, last_modified, concept_name, and type-specific fields).

Example documents:

The stored `text` is just `"Systolic blood pressure: 120 mmHg"`, but the embedding above is computed from `"Vital signs — Systolic blood pressure: 120 mmHg SBP"` per the [Synonyms and group obs convention](#synonyms-and-group-obs-convention) below. No separate parent group-aggregate document is emitted; consumers cluster atomic hits by `obs_group_uuid` when group-level rendering or multivariate reasoning is needed.

### Synonyms and group obs convention

Two cross-cutting conventions apply to documents that carry a primary clinical concept (obs, condition, diagnosis, drug_order, allergy, program, medication_dispense, test_order). Both decouple **stored shape** (what backends persist and consumers cite) from **embedding-input shape** (what the embedder sees), using the three-component model from this decision. Other example documents above omit `synonyms` for brevity, but their serializers populate it on the same rules.

**Synonyms.** Concept synonyms in the deployment's configured locale (per [Decision 8](#decision-8-locale-specific-serialization-with-multilingual-embeddings)) are kept on a `synonyms` field as a list of strings — deterministically sorted (SHORT-typed names alphabetically first, then non-SHORT names alphabetically). The stored `text` field contains the preferred name only, keeping LLM citations clean. Synonyms enrich retrieval through two paths: (1) the indexer concatenates them onto the embedding input so vectors are synonym-aware (a "HTN" query hits a doc whose preferred name is "Hypertension" without forcing every consumer to either strip parenthetical noise from text or implement query-side synonym expansion); (2) BM25-capable backends (Lucene and Elasticsearch per [Decision 3](#decision-3-pluggable-backend-spi-with-three-reference-implementations)) index `synonyms` as a top-level text field alongside `text` so exact-keyword matches on alternative terms are also handled. The MySQL tier's FULLTEXT engine (the explicitly limited keyword tier) covers only `text`; semantic-path synonym matching still works there via the embedding-input enrichment.

**SHORT-name promotion and cap.** SHORT-typed `ConceptName` entries (clinical abbreviations like `DTG` for Dolutegravir, `HTN` for Hypertension, `T2DM` for Type 2 Diabetes — how clinicians actually type queries) are returned unconditionally, ahead of and outside the cap. Non-SHORT synonyms remain capped at `MAX_NON_SHORT_SYNONYMS` (currently `10`, raised from the original `3`). The cap is on the non-SHORT bucket only; SHORT names are kept regardless of count. Same-string entries appearing in both buckets are deduplicated. Why split the buckets: under a single alphabetic cap, drug abbreviations were lost when locale-equivalent FQN variants happened to sort earlier — a search for `"DTG"` then missed the underlying dolutegravir record entirely. The promotion-and-raise split keeps the cap's IDF discipline for verbose dictionaries while guaranteeing the clinical abbreviations survive.

The cap raise from 3 → 10 has a real trade-off worth naming: synonyms feed *both* the BM25 channel (where larger vocabulary is unambiguously good) *and* the embedding input (where longer inputs subtly redistribute attention away from the preferred name). The 4-patient eval that ratified the change kept hybrid P@5 at 0.636 — flat against the pre-change baseline — confirming the embedding-side effect does not visibly degrade kNN retrieval at this cap level with the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model. If a future deployment swaps to a larger embedder with tighter score distributions or starts importing dictionaries with 20-50 synonyms per concept, this cap should be revisited under the same evidentiary bar: multi-patient eval + LLM-citation evidence.

**Re-bootstrap advisory on upgrade.** The SHORT-promotion and cap-raise change applies to documents produced AFTER the upgrade. Pre-upgrade documents in the Lucene/Elasticsearch index were computed with the 3-name cap and no SHORT-promotion guarantee — their synonyms field carries fewer terms than the new code would produce for the same concept. The shape of the field is unchanged, so no error surfaces; the symptom is silent: BM25 recall on pre-upgrade segments is lower than on post-upgrade segments. This is the same operational footprint as the [field-shape re-index event](#re-index--alias-strategy) the description-indexing slice carried. Operators on existing deployments should re-run `BootstrapService.bootstrap()` (after dropping the per-type Lucene FSDirectory / ES index) to recover full synonym coverage on every document.

**Description.** The concept's free-text description in the deployment's configured locale (with same-language fallback to any other available description; trimmed; whitespace-only entries dropped) is kept on a `description` field as a single string. The stored `text` field stays preferred-name-anchored, keeping LLM citations clean; description is BM25-only signal. Concept descriptions are authored by dictionary maintainers (CIEL, AMPATH, Bahmni) and naturally contain the clinical-category vocabulary patients use in queries — e.g. "Blood urea nitrogen" doesn't say "kidney" in its preferred name but its description does, and indexing the description gives BM25 a vocabulary bridge between natural-language questions and records whose name doesn't carry the category word. Unlike synonyms, description is **NOT** concatenated onto the embedding input — the description body is long, vocabulary-overlapping across related concepts (the "Weight" vs "Height" description-asymmetric-bias failure mode), and would compress the embedding's pairwise discrimination if included. Lucene and Elasticsearch index `description` as a top-level text field with a sub-1.0 boost ({@link QueryStoreConstants#BM25_DESCRIPTION_BOOST}, currently `0.5`) so the longer free-text body doesn't dominate term-frequency scoring on category-word queries; the MySQL tier's single-column FULLTEXT engine does not search it (same limitation as `synonyms`).

**Mapping names.** The concept's reference-term mapping names (LOINC's `Urea nitrogen [Moles/volume] in Serum or Plasma`, ICD-10's `Chronic kidney disease, unspecified`, PIH's `Chronic kidney disease`, WHO-ATC names, CIEL drug-class parents like `Heparins` / `Sulfonamides`) are kept on a `mapping_names` field as a deterministically-sorted list of strings, capped at `ConceptNameUtil.MAX_MAPPING_NAMES` (currently `10`). Sourced from `Concept.getConceptMappings()` → `ConceptMap.getConceptReferenceTerm().getName()`; retired terms and null/blank names are dropped. Same shape and exclusion contract as `description`: BM25-only signal, not added to embedding input (asymmetric-bias risk on multi-source vocabulary-overlapping names), Lucene and Elasticsearch index it as a top-level text field with `BM25_MAPPING_NAMES_BOOST = 0.5`, MySQL doesn't search it. The vocabulary source is external-authority dictionary maintainers (SNOMED, LOINC, ICD, RxNorm, WHO) — orders of magnitude more terminology labour than CIEL's own description authors — so the field bridges natural-language category-word queries to records whose preferred name lacks the matching term. Empirical end-to-end check on the reference standalone (May 2026): patient `07e26b8e` carries a `Chronic kidney insufficiency` Condition/Diagnosis pair; the query `"chronic kidney disease unspecified"` — a pure ICD-10 phrase whose tokens appear in zero concept's `text` field — returns those two records at ranks 1–2, with the only possible match path being the indexed `mapping_names` blob. Per-source availability is partial in practice: SNOMED licensing prevents OCL from distributing its `to_concept_name_resolved`, so SNOMED-only mapped concepts get no signal; LOINC / ICD-10 / PIH / WHO-ATC / CIEL drug-class names ARE distributed and form the bulk of the populated signal on a CIEL-imported deployment.

**Re-bootstrap advisory on upgrade.** Adding `mapping_names` is a top-level BM25 field-shape change ([per-decision re-index event](#re-index--alias-strategy)). Pre-upgrade Lucene segments and Elasticsearch documents carry no `mapping_names` field — BM25 recall on category-word queries that the new vocabulary would have bridged is lower on stale documents than on freshly-indexed ones, with no error surfacing. Operators on existing deployments should: drop the per-type Lucene FSDirectory / ES index, then re-run `BootstrapService.bootstrap()` to project every record through the updated serializers. On Elasticsearch specifically, alternatively a one-time `client.indices().putMapping(...)` adds the field to the live mapping but does not back-populate existing documents — only re-projection populates the field for past records. During the re-bootstrap window itself, querystore is briefly internally inconsistent: re-projected resource types carry `mapping_names`; types that haven't been re-indexed yet do not. A patient whose chart spans both (e.g. obs reprojected, conditions pending) will see asymmetric BM25 recall across resource types until bootstrap completes. The window is operator-observable in `BootstrapProgress` and resolves at completion; queries arriving during it return clinically valid results, just under-recalled on the not-yet-reprojected slice.

**Group obs.** Obs that are members of a group are indexed as atomic documents with `obs_group_uuid` and `obs_group_concept_name` set on the metadata. No parent (group-aggregate) document is emitted. The group concept name is concatenated onto the embedding input — but not the stored `text` — so a group-level semantic query like "vitals" matches member vectors without the prefix appearing in citations or duplicating across siblings. Multivariate reasoning happens at response time: consumers (LLM-driven or otherwise) cluster atomic hits by `obs_group_uuid` to assemble group-level narratives or reason over sibling values together. This preserves member-level structured filtering (`value_numeric` etc.) and avoids the storage duplication, cascade-on-edit, and citation-ambiguity costs of materializing parent docs.

**Embedding input construction.** For a coded record, the embedding input is `[obs_group_concept_name + " — "] + text + [" " + synonyms.join(" ")]` (bracketed parts conditional on presence). The stored `text` is unaffected. An indexer that has access to the structured fields can reconstruct the embedding input deterministically; round-tripping `text` through the embedder is therefore *not* the contract.

### Serializer conventions

Patterns common to all type-specific serializers, distilled from the Obs and Condition implementations. These are contract-level rules; the abstract base implements the template-method shape that enforces them.

**Cross-cutting `record_date` source.** The cross-cutting `record_date` field uses the type's most clinically meaningful "this record was made" timestamp:
- Types with a clinical-event time field (e.g., `obs_datetime` on Obs) use that.
- Types without one (e.g., Condition) fall back to `dateCreated` (the audit field).
- Onset, end, resolution, and other clinical-fact dates remain on dedicated metadata fields per [Decision 7](#decision-7-date-separation--excluded-from-embeddings-included-at-query-time) — they are *not* the cross-cutting `record_date`.

**Free-text annotations are metadata-only.** Free-text clinician annotations — `comment` on obs, `additional_detail` on condition, and the equivalent on other types — are excluded from the stored `text` field but indexed as metadata for BM25 keyword matching. Citation-clean text is the contract; consumers that want the annotation render it from the metadata field at presentation time.

**Coded-or-free-text fallback.** For types whose primary concept is wrapped in `CodedOrFreeText` (Condition, Diagnosis), the serializer resolves the display name as: coded concept's preferred name when present; otherwise the trimmed `non_coded` string. The non-coded string is also stored on the `non_coded` metadata field. The display name (coded or non-coded) is what appears in `text`; `concept_uuid`/`concept_name`/`synonyms` are populated only on the coded path.

**Status enums.** OpenMRS status enums whose values are HL7-aligned (`Obs.Interpretation`, `Obs.Status`, `ConditionClinicalStatus`, `ConditionVerificationStatus`, etc.) are serialized via `enum.name()` directly. The HL7-aligned constants are stable across OpenMRS versions; downstream consumers query against the enum-name strings (e.g., `interpretation = "ABNORMAL"`).

**Diagnosis rank labelling.** `Diagnosis.rank` is an `Integer` rather than an enum. Core treats `1` as primary (its private `HibernateDiagnosisDAO.PRIMARY_RANK`); any other rank is non-primary. The serializer maps `1 → "Primary"` and any other non-null integer → `"Secondary"`; null is omitted from both `text` and metadata. The same labelled string appears in `text` (`Rank: Primary`) and on the `rank` metadata field — consumers filter and cite against the label, not the integer. This is the only integer-to-label mapping in the serializer layer; HL7-aligned enums use `enum.name()` per the rule above.

**Clinical-date labels in text.** Clinically significant dates appear in `text` as labeled clauses with stable label conventions: `Onset:` for onset, `Resolved:` for end/resolution, `Stopped:` for order discontinuation, `Enrolled:` for program enrollment. The labels are part of the `text` contract — they appear in LLM citations — so they are not free to reword per type.

**Nested-object metadata arrays.** Multi-value structured fields (encounter `providers`, visit `attributes`, patient `identifiers` / `addresses` / `attributes`) are projected as a list of `LinkedHashMap<String, Object>` entries with a stable per-entry key set (e.g., `provider_uuid` / `provider_name` / `role_uuid` / `role_name` for providers; `type_uuid` / `type_name` / `value` for attributes). Absent keys are *omitted* from the entry rather than written as `null`, matching [Decision 9](#decision-9-coded-fields--store-both-uuid-and-name)'s omit-absent rule for top-level coded fields. The outer list is sorted by a domain-meaningful identity key — the entity's primary-key id when available (`encounterProviderId`, `visitAttributeId`), falling back to UUID for transient or test-constructed records — so the structured array and any citation-baked text derived from it (e.g., the encounter document's primary-provider clause) are stable across re-projections. The outer field key is the plural of the contained entity. For OpenMRS `BaseAttribute`-derived projections (`VisitAttribute`, future `LocationAttribute` / `ProviderAttribute`), the `value` field reads `getValueReference()` rather than `getValue()` — the latter invokes the custom-datatype deserializer and can throw `InvalidCustomValueException` on malformed persistent data, which would break the projection of an otherwise-valid record. The legacy `PersonAttribute` model is unaffected: it predates `BaseAttribute` and stores a plain `String value` directly, so `getValue()` is the right read for patient attributes.

**Encounter context is symmetric across encounter-bearing records.** Every record whose source entity hangs off an `Encounter` — obs, condition, diagnosis, drug_order, test_order, referral_order, allergy, medication_dispense — gets the full encounter context emitted via the shared `putEncounterContext` helper: `encounter_uuid`, `encounter_type_uuid` / `encounter_type_name`, `visit_uuid`, `form_uuid` / `form_name`, `location_uuid` / `location_name`, and `provider_uuid` / `provider_name` (the encounter's first active provider). The allergy example documents the full set, but the pattern is uniform — there is no per-type subset. Records that do not hang off an Encounter (patient, encounter itself, visit, program) omit these fields.

**Order family — orderer overrides encounter provider.** For `Order` subclasses (drug_order, test_order, referral_order, and any future Order-derived type), `Order.getOrderer()` is the authoritative source for `provider_uuid` / `provider_name` when non-null, overriding the encounter's first active provider that the shared encounter-context helper otherwise picks. If the orderer is null, the encounter-derived provider stays in place as a fallback. The orderer is the prescriber recorded directly on the order; the encounter's first active provider is whoever was attending the visit and is the right default for non-order records (obs, condition, diagnosis) but not for orders.

**ServiceOrder family — TestOrder and ReferralOrder share the abstract serializer.** Both `TestOrder` and `ReferralOrder` extend `ServiceOrder` and add no fields of their own, so the populate template (display name, ServiceOrder fields, Order-base fields, encounter context, orderer override) lives in a shared `AbstractServiceOrderRecordSerializer` and the concrete per-subtype serializers only declare the `resource_type`, supported entity class, and text-prefix discriminators. Per-subtype indices are preserved per [Decision 4](#decision-4-per-type-indices-over-a-single-index) — `querystore_test_order` and `querystore_referral_order` are distinct — but the field shape is identical, so the example doc and field-descriptions for `querystore_test_order` apply unchanged to `querystore_referral_order` (modulo the resource_type discriminator and the `Referral order:` text prefix).

**Skip semantics.** A serializer returns `null` from `serialize()` when the record produces no useful document — typically when the resolved display name is empty (e.g., an obs with no value, a condition with neither coded nor non-coded text, an obs group parent whose own value is empty). The caller (sync pipeline / backfill task) filters out null documents.

**Single-walk performance.** Each serializer walks its source record exactly once during `populate()`. The preferred concept name is resolved once and threaded into both the text composition and `putConceptFields` (rather than re-walking the names collection); date strings used in both `text` and metadata are formatted once and reused. This matters at bulk-backfill throughput where millions of records pass through the serializer.

### Field descriptions

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `patient_uuid` | Filter search to a single patient's chart, or aggregate across patients |
| `resource_type` | Distinguish record types (e.g., "obs", "condition", "diagnosis", "drug_order", "test_order", "referral_order", "allergy", "program", "medication_dispense", "patient", "encounter", "visit"); route documents to the correct per-type index |
| `resource_uuid` | Link back to the source record in OpenMRS (e.g., the obs UUID, condition UUID, order UUID, allergy UUID, patient UUID, encounter UUID, etc., depending on the resource_type) |
| `record_date` | Date range filtering and sorting (e.g., "labs from last 6 months", "most recent vital signs") |
| `last_modified` | Source-entity version timestamp (sourced from `dateChanged ?? dateCreated` for `BaseOpenmrsData` records) used by the backend as a write-version per [Decision 3](#decision-3-pluggable-backend-spi-with-three-reference-implementations) invariant 3 to drop stale concurrent writes. Optional: null disables version protection for that document (last-write-wins). Not a query-time field; carried for write coordination |
| `text` | BM25 keyword search matches against it; the LLM reads it when generating answers. Embedding input is derived from `text` enriched with `obs_group_concept_name` and `synonyms` per the [Synonyms and group obs convention](#synonyms-and-group-obs-convention); stored `text` itself stays focused for clean citations and is not what the embedder sees |
| `embedding` | Dense vector for semantic similarity search (e.g., "blood sugar control" matching an HbA1c result) |
| `concept_uuid` | Exact filtering by concept without relying on text matching (e.g., "all HbA1c results for this patient") |
| `concept_name` | Human-readable concept name in the deployment's configured locale (see [Decision 8](#decision-8-locale-specific-serialization-with-multilingual-embeddings)); supports keyword search and display |
| `concept_class` | Filter by category of clinical data (e.g., "Test", "Drug", "Diagnosis") |
| `synonyms` | (records with a primary concept) Locale-aware concept synonyms as a list of strings, capped per document and deterministically sorted. BM25-indexed by the Lucene and Elasticsearch backends as a top-level companion of `text` so exact-keyword matches on alternative terms work; concatenated onto embedding input at index time for synonym-aware vectors on every backend. Excluded from `text` to keep LLM citations clean. See [Synonyms and group obs convention](#synonyms-and-group-obs-convention) |
| `description` | (records with a primary concept) Locale-aware concept free-text description, trimmed, single string. BM25-indexed as a top-level companion of `text` with a sub-1.0 boost ({@link QueryStoreConstants#BM25_DESCRIPTION_BOOST}) so longer descriptions don't dominate term-frequency scoring; gives BM25 a vocabulary bridge from natural-language category-word queries to records whose preferred name doesn't carry the matching term. Deliberately excluded from embedding input (asymmetric-bias concern with vocabulary-overlapping descriptions). MySQL tier does not search it. See [Synonyms and group obs convention](#synonyms-and-group-obs-convention) |
| `mapping_names` | (records with a primary concept) Reference-term mapping names sourced from `Concept.getConceptMappings()` (LOINC / ICD-10 / PIH / WHO-ATC / CIEL drug-class parents). Alphabetically-sorted list of strings, capped at `ConceptNameUtil.MAX_MAPPING_NAMES`, retired terms and null/blank names dropped. BM25-indexed as a top-level companion of `text` with a sub-1.0 boost ({@link QueryStoreConstants#BM25_MAPPING_NAMES_BOOST}); deliberately excluded from embedding input (asymmetric-bias risk). MySQL tier does not search it. See [Synonyms and group obs convention](#synonyms-and-group-obs-convention) |
| `value_numeric` | Numeric range queries (e.g., "HbA1c values above 7", "systolic BP over 140") |
| `value_coded_uuid` | Exact filtering by coded answer concept (e.g., "all HIV-positive results", "all Yes answers to a symptom question") — null for numeric or text obs |
| `value_coded_name` | Human-readable coded answer name for display and keyword search — null for numeric or text obs |
| `value_drug_uuid` / `value_drug_name` | (obs whose coded answer points at a specific `Drug`) Drug-instance UUID and display name carried alongside `value_coded_uuid`/`value_coded_name`; lets coded answers distinguish a specific formulation (e.g., "Metformin 500mg tablet") from the generic concept ("Metformin"). Null for obs without a drug-typed answer |
| `value_text` | Raw free-text observation value for substring search and display — null for numeric or coded obs |
| `value_datetime` | (obs) Date/time observation value (e.g., "Date of last menstrual period"); null for non-datetime obs |

| `value_complex_uri` | (obs) Pointer back to core's complex-obs storage for observations whose value is bound to a `complexHandler` (images, PDFs, audio/video, long free text). Null for non-complex obs. The binary content itself is not stored in the read store; consumers fetch it from core. See the *Complex obs handling* open question for per-handler treatment |
| `value_complex_handler` | (obs) Name of the OpenMRS `complexHandler` that produced the value (e.g., `ImageHandler`, `BinaryDataHandler`, `LongFreeTextHandler`, `MediaHandler`). Routes consumer-side rendering and signals which handler-specific extraction (if any) was applied at index time |
| `obs_group_uuid` | (obs) UUID of the parent obs when this obs is part of a group (e.g., a BP panel with systolic and diastolic children); null for ungrouped obs |
| `obs_group_concept_name` | (obs) Denormalized name of the group concept when this obs is part of a group; null for ungrouped obs. Concatenated onto embedding input (but not stored `text`) so group-level semantic queries match member vectors. See [Synonyms and group obs convention](#synonyms-and-group-obs-convention) |

| `units` | Filter or group by unit of measurement |
| `interpretation` | Filter by clinical interpretation (e.g., "all abnormal results") |
| `non_coded` | (condition / diagnosis) Free-text label used when the clinician records a condition or diagnosis without selecting a concept; null when a coded `concept_uuid` is present |

| `encounter_uuid` | Group all clinical data from the same encounter; enables "what was recorded during visit X" queries across obs, orders, and diagnoses |
| `encounter_type_uuid` / `encounter_type_name` | (encounter-scoped records) Denormalized encounter type for filtering ("all admission obs", "all dispense events") without joining against the encounter index; UUID enables locale-independent filtering per [Decision 9](#decision-9-coded-fields--store-both-uuid-and-name) |
| `visit_uuid` | (encounter-scoped records) Denormalized visit pointer; lets you aggregate everything from one visit (which may span multiple encounters) without indirection through the encounter |
| `form_uuid` / `form_name` | (encounter-scoped records) Identifies which form captured the data; used for data-quality audits and form-scoped queries |
| `onset_date` | (conditions) Clinical date the condition started; distinct from `record_date` (the record creation date); included in the embedded text as a clinical fact per [Decision 7](#decision-7-date-separation--excluded-from-embeddings-included-at-query-time) |
| `order_number` | (orders) Human-readable order reference (e.g., ORD-1234) for display and linking back to source UI |

| `previous_order_uuid` | (orders) Links to the prior order in a revise/renew/discontinue chain; null for original orders. Required to reconstruct order history without scanning |
| `care_setting` | (orders) Inpatient vs. Outpatient setting; affects clinical interpretation of dose/frequency and is a common filter |
| `dose_units_uuid` / `dose_units` | (drug_order / medication_dispense) Coded unit for the dose amount (e.g., Tablet(s), mg, mL); UUID enables locale-independent filtering and resilience to concept renames per [Decision 9](#decision-9-coded-fields--store-both-uuid-and-name) |
| `quantity_units_uuid` / `quantity_units` | (drug_order / medication_dispense) Coded unit for the dispensed quantity; same UUID/name rationale as `dose_units` |
| `duration_units_uuid` / `duration_units` | (drug_order) Coded unit for order duration (e.g., Day(s), Week(s)); same UUID/name rationale as `dose_units` |
| `route_uuid` / `route` | (drug_order / medication_dispense) Coded administration route (e.g., Oral, Intravenous); UUID enables queries like "all injectable orders" without locale-dependent name matching |
| `frequency_uuid` / `frequency` | (drug_order / medication_dispense) Coded dosing frequency (e.g., twice daily, every 4 hours); UUID enables programmatic filtering of regimens that name-based matching can't reliably express across locales or deployments |
| `dosing_instructions` | (drug_order) Free-text directions to the patient (e.g., "Take with food"); included in the embedded text since it carries clinical meaning |
| `as_needed` / `as_needed_condition` | (drug_order) PRN flag and the condition under which the medication should be taken (e.g., "for pain"); critical to distinguish scheduled vs. PRN regimens |
| `num_refills` | (drug_order) Number of refills authorized; needed for adherence and supply-chain queries |
| `instructions` | (test_order) Free-text instructions to the lab/imaging team (e.g., "fasting required"); distinct from `clinical_history` which describes the patient's situation |
| `specimen_source_uuid` / `specimen_source_name` | (test_order) Specimen type for lab orders (e.g., "Whole blood", "Urine"); null for imaging or non-specimen orders |
| `reactions` | (allergies) Flat array of reaction names in the deployment's configured locale. Reaction UUIDs are intentionally omitted: reactions are always used as a refinement filter alongside `allergen_uuid`, never as the primary query axis (nobody queries "all patients with anaphylaxis" without first filtering by allergen or patient). Name-based matching is sufficient in this secondary role. The tradeoff accepted is that names are locale-dependent and mutable — if reaction-level UUID filtering becomes a real use case, adding a parallel `reaction_uuids` array is a serializer change plus a full re-index of `querystore_allergy`; no schema migration or data loss is involved since the query store can be rebuilt from source at any time (see [Decision 1](#decision-1-cqrs-pattern--separate-read-store-from-transactional-database)). |
| `current_state_uuid` | (programs) UUID of the current program state concept; enables locale-independent exact filtering (e.g., "all patients currently On ART") per [Decision 9](#decision-9-coded-fields--store-both-uuid-and-name) |
| `outcome_uuid` | (programs) UUID of the program outcome concept; enables locale-independent exact filtering of completed program outcomes per [Decision 9](#decision-9-coded-fields--store-both-uuid-and-name) |
| `drug_order_uuid` | (medication_dispense) UUID of the originating drug order; enables "was this order dispensed?" queries and links dispense records back to their prescriptions |

| `substitution_type_uuid` / `substitution_type` | (medication_dispense) Coded type of substitution (e.g., generic, therapeutic); null when `was_substituted` is false |
| `substitution_reason_uuid` / `substitution_reason` | (medication_dispense) Coded reason for the substitution (e.g., out of stock, formulary); null when `was_substituted` is false |
| `dispenser_uuid` / `dispenser_name` | (medication_dispense) Pharmacist or other staff who handed over the medication; distinct from `provider_uuid` (the prescribing clinician) |
| `given_name` / `middle_name` / `family_name` | (patient) Person name components; supports keyword search and display |
| `gender` | (patient) Filter by gender; codes follow OpenMRS conventions (e.g., M, F, O, U) |
| `birthdate` / `birthdate_estimated` | (patient) Date of birth and a flag indicating whether the date was estimated rather than known precisely; required for accurate age-based filtering |
| `age_years` | (patient) Pre-computed age at index time; convenient for "patients over 50" queries without date arithmetic. Note: this is a derived value and goes stale — clients that need point-in-time accuracy should compute from `birthdate` |
| `dead` / `death_date` / `cause_of_death_uuid` / `cause_of_death_name` | (patient) Mortality data; cause is a coded concept stored as UUID + name per [Decision 9](#decision-9-coded-fields--store-both-uuid-and-name) |
| `identifiers` | (patient) Array of identifier objects ({type_uuid, type_name, value, preferred, location_uuid}); enables exact-match lookup by MRN, national ID, etc. across types |
| `addresses` | (patient) Array of address objects with structured city/state/country fields; supports geographic filtering and aggregation |
| `attributes` | (patient / visit) Array of typed attribute objects ({type_uuid, type_name, value}); captures deployment-specific metadata (telephone, insurance, etc.) without hard-coding fields |
| `providers` | (encounters) Array of provider objects ({provider_uuid, provider_name, role_uuid, role_name}); encounters can have multiple providers in different roles, unlike single-provider events |
| `visit_type_uuid` / `visit_type_name` | (visits) Coded visit type (e.g., Outpatient, Inpatient); UUID enables locale-independent filtering per [Decision 9](#decision-9-coded-fields--store-both-uuid-and-name) |
| `start_date_time` / `end_date_time` | (visits) Full timestamp boundaries; visits are time-ranged rather than single-instant events. `end_date_time` is null when the visit is still active |
| `active` | (visits) Boolean computed from `end_date_time IS NULL`; redundant but enables faster filtering of active vs. closed visits |
| `indication_uuid` / `indication_name` | (visits) Coded reason for the visit; UUID enables locale-independent filtering per [Decision 9](#decision-9-coded-fields--store-both-uuid-and-name) |
| `encounter_uuids` | (visits) Array of encounter UUIDs that belong to this visit; lets a visit document be the entry point for traversal without a reverse lookup |
| `location_uuid` | Exact filtering by location, avoiding ambiguity from duplicate or similar location names |
| `location_name` | Human-readable location name for display, keyword search, and aggregation (e.g., "obs count per facility") |
| `provider_uuid` | Exact filtering by provider, avoiding ambiguity from duplicate or similar provider names |
| `provider_name` | Human-readable provider name for display, keyword search, and workload analysis |

### Rationale
Each component serves distinct purposes that the others cannot fulfill:

- **Text chunk** (`text`): BM25 keyword search matches against it. The embedding model was run on it. The LLM reads it when generating answers. Without it, you can find a match but have nothing to display or feed to the LLM.
- **Vector embedding** (`embedding`): Enables semantic similarity search. Without it, you can only do keyword matching.
- **Structured metadata** (all other fields): Enables precise filtering, sorting, aggregation, and linking back to source records. Neither keyword nor semantic search can reliably answer queries like "labs from last 6 months with value above 7 at Kenyatta National Hospital."

Elasticsearch and OpenSearch can combine all three in a single query — kNN on the vector, BM25 on the text, and filters on the metadata — making the three-component model a natural fit on the cluster tier. The Lucene and MySQL tiers achieve the same surface via the `BackendStore.hybrid` interface-default RRF over separately-ranked BM25 and kNN results, as pinned in [Decision 3](#decision-3-pluggable-backend-spi-with-three-reference-implementations).

### Consequences
- Storage per document is larger than text-only or embedding-only approaches.
- Index mappings must be maintained for type-specific structured fields.
- Embedding generation adds a processing step during synchronization (either via an external API or a local model).

## Decision 7: Date Separation — Excluded from Embeddings, Included at Query Time

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Clinical records have observation dates (when the record was created). These dates are important for clinical reasoning (e.g., "most recent lab result") but affect embedding quality.

### Decision
Exclude observation dates from the text that is embedded. Include dates as structured metadata fields in the read-store document and prepend them to the text only at LLM prompt assembly time.

- **For embedding**: `"Fasting blood glucose: 11.2 mmol/L"`
- **For LLM prompt**: `"(2025-03-15) Fasting blood glucose: 11.2 mmol/L"`
- **For filtering**: `"record_date": "2025-03-15"` as a structured field

### Rationale
Two identical clinical observations recorded on different dates are semantically identical — they mean the same thing clinically. Including dates in the text would produce different embedding vectors for the same clinical content, reducing retrieval quality. A search for "abnormal blood sugar" should find all abnormal blood sugar results equally, regardless of when they were recorded.

Dates are still available through:
- The `record_date` metadata field for range filtering and sorting.
- Prepending at prompt assembly time when the LLM needs temporal context for reasoning.

**Exception**: Clinically significant dates that are distinct from the record timestamp should be included in the embedded text — for example, condition resolution dates, order discontinuation dates, or program enrollment dates. These represent clinical facts, not administrative timestamps.

### Consequences
- The serialization layer must distinguish between record timestamps (excluded from text) and clinically significant dates (included in text).
- Prompt assembly logic must prepend dates when constructing LLM input.
- Date-based retrieval relies on structured filtering rather than semantic search, which is more precise anyway.

## Decision 8: Locale-Specific Serialization with Multilingual Embeddings

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Concept names in OpenMRS are locale-specific. A concept like "Fasting blood glucose" may be stored as "Glycémie à jeun" in French or "Glukosa darah puasa" in Indonesian. The serialized text used for embedding and search must account for this, since:

- Embeddings are language-sensitive — mixing languages in the same index dilutes search quality.
- BM25 keyword search does not match across languages (e.g., "blood glucose" will not match "Glycémie à jeun").
- The LLM needs consistent language to reason over the chart.

Options considered:

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| Serialize in one fixed locale (e.g., English) | Standardized, best monolingual embedding quality | Clinicians may not search in English |
| Serialize in the deployment's default locale | Text matches the language clinicians use | Embedding quality varies by language with monolingual models |
| Serialize in multiple locales per record | Best retrieval across languages | Multiplies storage and indexing cost |
| Serialize in the deployment's locale, embed with a multilingual model | Practical, natural language for clinicians, cross-language similarity | Slightly lower embedding quality than monolingual models |

### Decision
Serialize concept names in the deployment's configured locale and use a multilingual embedding model (e.g., `multilingual-e5`) for vector generation.

**The embedding provider is an SPI.** Querystore depends on an `EmbeddingProvider` interface that exposes `embed(text) -> float[]`, `embedQuery(text) -> float[]` (for dual-encoder models like MedCPT where queries and documents use different encoders), and `getDimensions()`. Querystore ships a default ONNX-based provider, pluggable to any BERT-class model file via configuration (`querystore.embedding.modelFilePath`, `querystore.embedding.vocabFilePath`).

Deployments select the active provider via an explicit configuration property (`querystore.embedding.providerBean=<beanName>`); only one provider is active at a time. Modules may *register* an `EmbeddingProvider` bean — for example, a clinical-domain model packaged by an extension module — but cannot make their bean active. That selection is a deployment-level decision, consistent with [Decision 13](#decision-13-module-extension-spi-service-provider-interface-for-custom-resource-types)'s rule that modules do not pick the embedding model their text is embedded with. The default model packaged with querystore must satisfy the multilingual constraint stated in this decision; any replacement provider must as well. (The bean-name-based selection mechanism is a v1 simplification; a future revision may replace it with a more refactor-resistant qualifier annotation or registry approach if bean-name fragility becomes a real problem in practice.)

The embedding model identifier and its dimensions are part of the public contract surfaced through the SPI per [Decision 13](#decision-13-module-extension-spi-service-provider-interface-for-custom-resource-types) — every consumer that issues kNN queries must embed its query text with the same model querystore used at index time, or vectors are incomparable and results silently break.

### Rationale
1. **Clinicians search in their own language.** A French-speaking clinician will type "glycémie" not "blood glucose." The serialized text and BM25 index should match the language they use.
2. **Multilingual embedding models handle cross-language similarity.** Models like `multilingual-e5` are trained across 100+ languages and produce comparable vectors for semantically equivalent text regardless of language.
3. **Single serialization per record keeps storage and indexing simple.** Storing multiple locale variants per record would multiply storage cost and complicate synchronization without proportional benefit.
4. **Consistent with OpenMRS conventions.** OpenMRS already resolves concept names to the configured locale throughout its UI and APIs.
5. **Pluggable provider, fixed contract.** Different deployments have different inference budgets — a small site may want a 384-dim CPU-friendly model, a research network may want a clinical-domain model, a centralised deployment may proxy to a remote embedding API. The SPI lets all of these coexist with one document model. chartsearchai's `OnnxEmbeddingProvider` already proves this pattern works in practice (model-agnostic, dual-encoder support, dimension auto-detection); querystore inherits that approach rather than reinventing it.

### Consequences
- The embedding model must be multilingual. Monolingual models (e.g., English-only) should not be used.
- Deployments that change their default locale after initial indexing will need to re-serialize and re-index existing records.
- Cross-deployment searches (e.g., a research network spanning French and English sites) would require additional consideration, potentially storing an English canonical form alongside the localized text.
- Swapping the embedding provider is a re-index event — the new model produces different vectors for the same text, and existing kNN results become incomparable to fresh queries until the index is rebuilt. This couples to the [Embedding model versioning](#embedding-model-versioning) and [Re-index / alias strategy](#re-index--alias-strategy) open questions.
- The provider SPI is independent of the backend SPI ([Decision 3](#decision-3-pluggable-backend-spi-with-three-reference-implementations)). Choice of MySQL/Lucene/Elasticsearch does not constrain choice of embedding provider, and vice versa.

### Empirical validation (chartsearchai, May 2026)

chartsearchai's [Decision 22](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-chartsearchai/blob/main/docs/adr.md#decision-22-e5-base-v2-for-the-querystore-backed-retrieval-path) is the first real-world consumer evaluation of this decision's multilingual constraint. On its LLM-as-filter consumer pattern — querystore returns the top-K, the local LLM does the filtering in the answer phase — chartsearchai compared three embedders on real patient charts at `chartsearchai.querystore.enabled=true` with `topK=30`:

- `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384 dims, ~90MB) — missed colloquial-to-clinical bridges; "any heart issues?" returned 0 records for a patient with Cerebrovascular Accident in the chart.
- `intfloat/e5-base-v2` (768 dims, ~440MB, via the self-contained `Xenova/e5-base-v2` ONNX export) — bridged the colloquial-to-clinical gap; the LLM correctly cited the CVA records on the same query.
- `ncbi/MedCPT-*` (dual-encoder, 768 dims) — refused the bridge; its PubMed-trained clusters pedantically separated lay phrasing from clinical terms.

The finding: with the LLM doing the filtering, the dominant retrieval failure mode is **vocabulary gaps** between how users phrase questions and how clinical records are written; the embedder's job in this regime is to put plausible candidates in the top-K, not to feed an adaptive-filtering pipeline. e5-base-v2's multilingual training surfaces those vocabulary bridges where L6-v2's tighter clusters miss them.

The choice is consumer-side — querystore itself still prescribes no model, per the SPI design above — but the evaluation confirms that the multilingual constraint stated in this decision is load-bearing for clinical retrieval at LLM-as-filter altitudes, not a precaution. Deployments without their own evaluation criteria can use `e5-base-v2` as a known-good multilingual default; consumers with specific requirements (clinical-domain models, CPU-budget constraints, dual-encoder architectures) select via `querystore.embedding.providerBean`.

## Decision 9: Coded Fields — Store Both UUID and Name

### Status
Accepted

### Context
Many fields in the document model reference OpenMRS concepts — allergen, drug, program, program state, outcome, reaction, and others. Each can be represented as a UUID, a human-readable name, or both. The choice affects what query patterns are possible.

### Decision
For coded fields, store both the UUID and the human-readable name. Apply a narrow exception for small, stable, locale-invariant value sets where name-only is acceptable.

Examples following the rule:
- `allergen_uuid` + `allergen_name`
- `concept_uuid` + `concept_name`
- `drug_uuid` + `drug_name`
- `program_uuid` + `program_name`
- `current_state_uuid` + `current_state`
- `outcome_uuid` + `outcome`
- `value_coded_uuid` + `value_coded_name`

Examples following the exception (name only):
- `severity` in allergies — three stable values (Mild, Moderate, Severe) that are unlikely to vary by locale or change over time; programmatic filtering by severity UUID is not a realistic use case

### Rationale
UUID and name serve different consumers and different query patterns:

- **UUID** enables stable, locale-independent programmatic filtering. A developer querying "all patients currently On ART" writes a filter against `current_state_uuid` using the known concept UUID. This works regardless of what locale the deployment uses or whether the concept name is later updated.
- **Name** enables keyword search (BM25 matches against it) and human-readable display. A clinician searching "On ART" by text hits the name field.

Without the UUID, programmatic filtering must use name strings, which breaks when the deployment locale differs from the query or when concept names change. Without the name, keyword search and display require an extra lookup against OpenMRS core.

The exception applies when all three conditions hold: the value set is small (handful of values), the values are stable (unlikely to be renamed), and the values are locale-invariant (the same string is used across all deployments). Allergy severity meets all three. Most other coded fields do not.

### Consequences
- Every coded field requires two document fields instead of one.
- Serializers must resolve both the UUID and the locale-specific name for each coded value at index time.
- When adding a new coded field, the default should be to store both UUID and name unless the exception conditions are explicitly evaluated and met.

## Decision 10: Voided Records — Deleted from the Read Store, Not Marked

### Status
Accepted

### Context
OpenMRS uses logical deletion in its transactional database. When a record is voided, the row remains in the underlying tables with a `voided` flag set, preserving audit information on the write side. The read store must decide how to handle void events from core.

Three options were considered:

| Option | Behavior on void event | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| Delete from index | Document is removed from the read store | Simplest reads; no audit on read side |
| Keep with `voided` flag | Document stays; every query must filter `voided=false` | Audit available on read side; every consumer must remember the filter |
| Parallel audit index | Move voided documents to a sibling index (e.g., `querystore_obs_voided`) | Clean separation; doubles index management |

### Decision
On a void event, delete the corresponding document from the read store. No `voided` field is stored on documents.

**Symmetric: unvoid → re-project.** Voiding deletes; unvoiding must restore. Because no `voided` field is stored, an unvoid event has no document to flip — the read store has no record at all. The sync pipeline therefore treats unvoid like an upsert: re-serialize the source record from core and write a fresh document, with the same idempotent `resource_uuid`-keyed write that an initial save would produce. Every `*IndexingAdvice` in the bridge layer includes the unvoid method alongside save/edit in its trigger set, and the per-node voided-flag dispatch in `AbstractIndexingAdvice.dispatch` routes each entity by its current state (voided → delete, non-voided → index) regardless of which advice method fired. Cascading unvoids (e.g., unvoiding an Encounter that also unvoids its child obs) flow through the same per-node fan-out as void-cascades, just in the opposite direction.

### Rationale
1. **Audit lives in core, not the projection.** Per [Decision 1](#decision-1-cqrs-pattern--separate-read-store-from-transactional-database), core remains the source of truth and the read store is rebuildable. The audit data model is already designed for the write side. Replicating audit responsibility into a query-optimized projection mixes concerns and makes the read store a partial, lossy copy of something core already does completely.
2. **Filter-everywhere is fragile.** Keeping voided records means every default query must include `voided=false`. A single forgotten filter surfaces clinically retracted data to a clinician or LLM. Deletion is a stronger guarantee than a convention.
3. **Voided records pollute semantic search.** Vectors for retracted records still match in kNN search unless filtered. A voided abnormal lab result could surface as a top semantic match for a query like "blood sugar control" and end up in an LLM prompt — a clinical safety problem, not just a quality issue.
4. **Storage cost.** Voided records consume index space (text + vector + structured metadata) for no read-side benefit, since the canonical record is preserved in core.

The brief eventual-consistency window between a void in core and its propagation to the read store is acceptable, consistent with the trade-off already accepted in [Decision 1](#decision-1-cqrs-pattern--separate-read-store-from-transactional-database). Idempotent delete-by-`resource_uuid` handles late-arriving and duplicate void events without special logic.

### Consequences
- Sync logic must handle void events explicitly, deleting by `resource_uuid` from the appropriate per-type index.
- Consumers needing audit or historical context (e.g., "who recorded a value that was later voided?") must query core directly. The read store cannot answer such questions and should not be expected to.
- Revision-chain pointers (`previous_version_uuid` on conditions, `previous_order_uuid` on orders) may dangle when an earlier version was voided rather than superseded — they will reference UUIDs no longer present in the read store. This is acceptable: the pointer's value is informational ("this revises an earlier record"), and full history retrieval belongs in core.
- "Show deleted" workflows for QA, debugging, or compliance review are not supported by the read store. If such a use case emerges later, it should be addressed by a separate, scoped decision (e.g., a parallel audit index or a time-bounded soft-tombstone) rather than by retrofitting `voided` onto every document.

## Decision 11: Retired Metadata — Data References Preserved, Names Snapshotted

### Status
Accepted

### Context
OpenMRS distinguishes two forms of logical removal:

- **Voided** applies to clinical data records (obs, orders, conditions, allergies, encounters, visits, patients). It means "this record was wrong, retract it." Handled by [Decision 10](#decision-10-voided-records--deleted-from-the-read-store-not-marked).
- **Retired** applies to metadata records (concepts, drugs, locations, providers, encounter types, visit types, forms, programs, services). It means "do not use this entry for new records, but historical references to it remain valid."

The two are not interchangeable. Retiring a concept does not invalidate the obs that reference it, in the same way that a clinician leaving a hospital does not invalidate the encounters they conducted while employed there. The read store needs an explicit policy for how retirement of referenced metadata propagates — or doesn't — to data documents.

### Decision
1. Data documents that reference retired or renamed metadata are kept unchanged. No data is removed, retracted, or rewritten in response to a retirement or rename event.
2. No `retired` flag is added to data documents.
3. Denormalized metadata names (e.g., `concept_name`, `location_name`, `provider_name`, `drug_name`, `encounter_type_name`, `form_name`, `program_name`, `service_name`, etc.) reflect the value at index time. They are not re-fetched when the underlying metadata is retired or renamed.
4. Direct metadata indices (e.g., a hypothetical `querystore_concepts` for picker UX) are not in scope. If introduced later, their retirement-handling rules are a separate decision and will likely differ — those indices exist precisely to drive new-entry filtering, where retirement *is* a primary query axis. The criterion for whether a metadata type warrants an index at all is captured in [Decision 13's Criteria for contributing a metadata resource type](#criteria-for-contributing-a-metadata-resource-type); most metadata types fail it. The broader question of which knowledge-base resources to project, when, and via what mechanism is tracked as the [Knowledge-base and reference-data projection](#knowledge-base-and-reference-data-projection) open question.

### Rationale
1. **Retirement is forward-looking, not retroactive.** Its purpose is to prevent future use of a metadata entry, not to invalidate historical references. A diabetes diagnosis recorded against a since-retired concept is still a real diagnosis — the patient was diagnosed, the record reflects what happened. Treating retirement as if it were voiding would silently rewrite clinical history.
2. **Adding a `retired` field gives consumers nothing actionable.** Unlike voided data (which must be hidden by default for safety), retired metadata is *expected* to appear in historical references. There is no default filter consumers should apply, so the field would only add storage cost and confusion.
3. **Denormalized names go stale on any metadata change.** Renames during retirement are one instance of a broader phenomenon — concept names, location names, and provider names all drift. The query store accepts eventual consistency on metadata names *and on the embeddings derived from them* per [Decision 1](#decision-1-cqrs-pattern--separate-read-store-from-transactional-database); re-indexing is the standard remedy when freshness matters. Treating retirement renames specially would create a one-off code path for a problem that already has a general solution.
4. **Auto fan-out on metadata-rename events is rejected on cost grounds.** The alternative to accepting staleness — subscribing to rename events and re-projecting every document that references the renamed UUID at sync time — turns rename events into potentially very large operational hammers. A single popular concept rename (e.g., a frequently-recorded diagnosis or vital sign) can touch millions of obs documents, each requiring text re-render and a fresh embedding. Folding that cost into steady-state sync was judged disproportionate to the freshness benefit, given that the staleness is recoverable by re-indexing on demand. This is the load-bearing reason the policy is "accept staleness," not an abstract preference for eventual consistency. The cost may be revisitable via the lighter-weight [Name-refresh re-projection](#name-refresh-re-projection) path tracked below; this decision does not foreclose it.
5. **Metadata-state queries belong in core.** Questions like "is this concept currently retired?" or "what concept replaced this retired one?" are metadata management concerns, not query workloads over clinical data. The read store is optimized for the latter; the former is core's job.

### Consequences
- Sync logic ignores retirement *and rename* events on metadata records. Only voiding (data records) and changes to indexed data trigger read-store mutations. Auto fan-out on metadata renames is rejected on cost grounds (see Rationale point 4); retirement is a no-op by virtue of "data references are preserved."
- Denormalized metadata names may be out of sync with core after a rename (whether retirement-driven or otherwise) until the next re-index. Consumers requiring authoritative metadata names must consult core or trigger a re-sync.
- Aggregations over denormalized names (e.g., "obs count grouped by `concept_name`") may attribute records to the pre-rename name. UUID-based aggregations are unaffected, which reinforces [Decision 9](#decision-9-coded-fields--store-both-uuid-and-name)'s rationale for storing both UUID and name.
- Stale denormalized names extend into the embedding vector. Document text is the input to embedding generation ([Decision 6](#decision-6-document-model--text-embeddings-and-structured-metadata)), so a rename leaves the *old* name baked into both the structured `*_name` field and the embedding vector. Semantic search against the new name will miss those documents until they are re-indexed. UUID-keyed queries and UUID-based aggregations are unaffected. The remedy named in this decision — a targeted re-index of the affected resource type — is itself an expensive operation (a full re-index of `querystore_obs` in any decent-sized site is millions of documents of embedding-generation cost), so in practice renames may sit unfixed until the staleness accumulates enough to justify that cost. A lighter-weight path that touches only the documents referencing the renamed UUID is discussed in the [Name-refresh re-projection](#name-refresh-re-projection) open question.
- If direct metadata indices are added later, this decision does not apply to them. A separate decision should specify retirement handling for any such index, where keeping retired entries with a `retired=true` flag is the likely choice (the opposite of [Decision 10](#decision-10-voided-records--deleted-from-the-read-store-not-marked)'s approach to voided clinical data, because the use cases are inverted).

## Decision 12: Sync Mechanism — Events First, AOP as Last-Resort Gap Filler

### Status
Accepted

### Context
[Decision 1](#decision-1-cqrs-pattern--separate-read-store-from-transactional-database) establishes the CQRS pattern (separate read store, eventually consistent with core) and names "events or AOP" as candidate sync mechanisms without picking one. The choice cascades into coverage, coupling, latency, and operational complexity, and several other decisions implicitly depend on the answer.

Candidates considered:

| Mechanism | Coverage | Coupling | Async | Infra cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OpenMRS Event module | Whatever core publishes | Loose — public event contract | Yes | Adds Event module + JMS broker |
| AOP (pointcuts on services) | Everything routed through service methods | Tight — internal service interfaces | Synchronous unless explicitly wrapped | None additional |
| Database CDC (Debezium / binlog) | Everything, including direct DAO writes | Tight — to core's DB schema | Yes | Requires MySQL binlog enabled and row-based/GTID replication; runtime can be embedded (Debezium Engine) or standalone |
| Polling | Anything queryable with a timestamp | Loose | N/A | None additional |

### Decision
Use the OpenMRS Event module as the primary sync mechanism. Subscribe to create / update / void events for the entity types this module indexes and apply the corresponding mutations to the read store.

Where event coverage is incomplete in the supported core version, the preferred remedy is to patch core to emit the missing event. AOP is permitted only as a targeted gap filler — scoped to specific entity types where patching core is not feasible — and is treated as tech debt to be removed once core catches up.

CDC and polling are excluded for the steady-state sync path. Polling is acceptable only for the initial backfill at install or after a rebuild (tracked as an open question below).

### Rationale
1. **Aligns with CQRS conventions.** Events are the canonical mechanism for read-side projections: core publishes, the projection consumes. [Decision 1](#decision-1-cqrs-pattern--separate-read-store-from-transactional-database)'s "data flows one way: from core to the query store" is most naturally implemented this way.
2. **Established precedent in the OpenMRS ecosystem.** The FHIR2 module already uses the Event module to maintain a derived representation of clinical data. Following the same pattern keeps the operational picture consistent for deployers and avoids introducing a new sync paradigm alongside an existing one.
3. **Decouples from internal service shapes.** AOP pointcuts attach to specific service method signatures; core renames, refactors, and method-extraction routinely break them. Events are a stable public contract that survives core's internal changes.
4. **Async by default.** Event handlers run off the clinical request thread, so indexing latency and embedding generation do not slow clinical workflows. AOP would block the calling thread (and its transaction) unless explicitly wrapped, adding complexity.
5. **Gaps are addressable upstream.** If the supported core version doesn't emit an event needed here, patching core is the right fix and benefits every projection that follows. Falling back to AOP for the remaining gaps preserves coverage without abandoning the events-first model for the entity types that already work.
6. **CDC trades loose code coupling for tight schema coupling.** Debezium tailing the MySQL binlog catches every write regardless of code path, and it does not require Kafka — the embedded Debezium Engine can run inside this module's JVM and write directly to Elasticsearch. The disqualifying problem is not infrastructure footprint but *what's being coupled to*: every column rename, table normalization, or schema migration in core silently breaks the CDC consumer, with no compile-time signal. Row-level deltas also have to be translated back into domain semantics (e.g., reconstructing "obs voided" from a row UPDATE setting `voided=1`), reproducing logic the service layer would have given for free. Enabling MySQL binlog in row-based / GTID mode is a non-trivial change for production DBAs to accept on a transactional clinical database. Together, these costs are disproportionate to the benefit for OpenMRS deployments. Can be revisited if scale or coverage demands force it.
7. **Platform-level CDC is a different proposition.** Adding Debezium to the Event module itself — tracked upstream as [TRUNK-6516](https://openmrs.atlassian.net/browse/TRUNK-6516) under the [TRUNK-6507](https://openmrs.atlassian.net/browse/TRUNK-6507) "Add integration middleware" epic — sidesteps the schema-coupling concern in (6) because core does the row-to-domain translation centrally. Querystore would continue to consume domain events as before, but those events would also cover writes that bypass the service layer today (Liquibase migrations, direct SQL). The events-first decision absorbs that upgrade without modification, and the [Sync reliability and reconciliation](#sync-reliability-and-reconciliation) gap narrows substantially when it lands.

### Consequences
- This module depends on the OpenMRS Event module and a JMS broker (ActiveMQ by default). Deployments must run this infrastructure.
- A gap inventory must be maintained: for each indexed resource type (obs, condition, diagnosis, drug_order, test_order, allergy, program, medication_dispense, patient, encounter, visit), record whether core emits create / update / void / purge events and at what granularity. Purge events are called out explicitly alongside void because cascading deletes (e.g., purging a patient triggers deletion of their obs, orders, encounters) are core's domain knowledge — the read store consumes whatever per-record events core fans out and does not reproduce cascade logic. A missing purge or cascaded-delete event is a coverage gap, not a read-store responsibility. Gaps drive either upstream PRs to core or a scoped AOP shim.
- Any AOP introduced as a gap filler must be documented with the entity type it covers, the core gap it works around, and a removal plan tied to a future core version.
- Event payloads in OpenMRS are often minimal (UUID + action). Handlers therefore fetch the full entity from core after receiving an event. This means the sync path performs reads against the transactional database — acceptable, but worth noting since it couples sync throughput to core's read performance.
- Lost events on broker restart are possible. Reliability, monitoring, and reconciliation are not solved by this decision and are tracked as separate open questions.
- The initial bootstrap / backfill mechanism is not specified here. The steady-state mechanism only handles changes from the moment the projection is running; getting from "empty index" to "in sync" is a separate concern, also tracked below.

### Migration bridge (time-bound)

The OpenMRS Event module work that this decision depends on is not yet shipped. During the gap, querystore needs a working write path so that consumers — chartsearchai in particular — can migrate to the read store on a realistic timeline rather than waiting on upstream. The bridge:

- **AOP runs broadly during the bridge window**, not only as a scoped gap filler. For each indexed core resource type (obs, condition, diagnosis, drug_order, test_order, referral_order, allergy, patient_program, medication_dispense, patient, encounter, visit), a per-type aspect on the corresponding core service's save / void / purge methods drives the same `serialize → embed → index` pipeline that event handlers will drive later.
- **Per-type aspect classes, not a mega-aspect.** One class per resource type so aspects can be retired type-by-type as the corresponding event subscriber lands, instead of an all-or-nothing flip.
- **Multiple aspects per service discriminate by type-token.** A core service can host more than one resource type (`PatientService` carries Patient and Allergy; `OrderService` carries drug, test, and referral orders), so several aspects register on the same `<point>` and each one filters via `args[0] instanceof <SpecificType>`. The per-subclass type-token is the only thing keeping the aspects from cross-projecting; declaring a too-broad supertype (e.g., `Order` instead of `DrugOrder`) silently makes the aspect project every sibling subtype.
- **After-commit, async.** Aspects register a `TransactionSynchronization.afterCommit` callback that hands the entity to a small executor. Indexing never blocks the clinical request thread and never runs against uncommitted state. Failures are logged and swallowed (parity with chartsearchai's current best-effort posture).
- **Each aspect carries an explicit removal marker** — class-level Javadoc naming the events-team ticket whose merge triggers deletion, and a tracking issue filed at aspect-merge time.
- **Cascade-delete gap is accepted for the window.** AOP on a patient's save / purge does not see cascaded obs / order / encounter deletes that core's DAOs perform; reconciliation (see [Sync reliability and reconciliation](#sync-reliability-and-reconciliation)) eventually catches orphan documents. Not solved here.
- **The events-first model remains the long-term target.** Once an event subscriber for a type ships and is verified against AOP behavior (parity test: the same save produces the same document via both paths), the corresponding aspect is deleted. Double-firing during the verification overlap is harmless because `index()` is upsert-idempotent. After events ship for all bridge-covered types, the "scoped gap-filler only" rule in the main Decision reasserts in full.

The bridge is a deliberate, time-bound widening of AOP's scope, not a supersession. Aspects added under the bridge that outlive their corresponding event subscriber are tech debt by definition and must be tracked accordingly.

## Decision 13: Module Extension SPI (Service Provider Interface) for Custom Resource Types

### Status
Accepted

### Context
OpenMRS's module ecosystem ships clinical data beyond what core defines: radiology reports, bed assignments, vaccination records, oncology regimens, custom form outputs, lab extensions, and many others. Consumers (clinical UIs, AI/analytics tools like Chart Search AI, reporting modules) want unified retrieval across all of this data, not just core types.

Three approaches were considered:

| Option | What querystore does | What modules do | Coupling |
|---|---|---|---|
| Closed scope (core types only) | Indexes core types | Ship their own per-module indices | None, but consumers must federate across multiple stores |
| Monolithic querystore | Indexes everything, knows every module's entities | Nothing | Querystore depends on every data-owning module |
| Module extension SPI | Provides shared infrastructure and a contribution interface | Contribute serializers, event subscribers, and own per-type index | Modules depend on querystore; querystore knows nothing about specific modules |

### Decision
Adopt the module extension SPI (Service Provider Interface) model. Querystore exposes a Java interface that data-owning modules implement to contribute custom resource types; querystore discovers implementations at runtime via the OpenMRS module loader and wires them into the indexing pipeline without ever depending on the contributing module directly. Each contributing module:

1. Declares a `resource_type` name namespaced by the contributing module's OpenMRS moduleid: `<moduleid>_<type>` (e.g., `radiology_report` from a module with moduleid `radiology`, `oncology_regimen` from `oncology`, `bedmgmt_assignment` from `bedmgmt`). The corresponding index name is `querystore_<moduleid>_<type>`. This inherits OpenMRS's existing moduleid-uniqueness guarantee for free — no separate registry or governance process is needed — and matches how OpenMRS already namespaces global properties and event topics. Names without a moduleid segment (`querystore_obs`, `querystore_condition`, `querystore_patient`, etc.) are reserved for the types this module itself indexes from core; module contributions always carry a moduleid segment between the `querystore_` prefix and the type suffix.
2. Provides a serializer that maps the entity to text + structured fields per [Decision 5](#decision-5-plain-text-serialization-over-json-or-fhir).
3. Provides an event subscriber per [Decision 12](#decision-12-sync-mechanism--events-first-aop-as-last-resort-gap-filler), or a scoped AOP shim where the module's services don't yet emit events. The same gap-inventory and tech-debt rules apply.
4. Receives a per-type index `querystore_<resource_type>` under [Decision 4](#decision-4-per-type-indices-over-a-single-index)'s naming convention.

Querystore retains ownership of the shared infrastructure:
- Backend connection and per-type store lifecycle (creation, mapping/schema, alias management) — abstracted by the backend SPI per [Decision 3](#decision-3-pluggable-backend-spi-with-three-reference-implementations) so the contributing module is unaware which tier is running.
- The embedding pipeline ([Decision 8](#decision-8-locale-specific-serialization-with-multilingual-embeddings)). Modules provide text; querystore embeds. Modules may register an `EmbeddingProvider` bean per the SPI in [Decision 8](#decision-8-locale-specific-serialization-with-multilingual-embeddings), but selecting which provider is active is a deployment-level configuration, not a module-level decision — modules cannot silently override the model their text is embedded with.
- Voiding ([Decision 10](#decision-10-voided-records--deleted-from-the-read-store-not-marked)) and retired-metadata ([Decision 11](#decision-11-retired-metadata--data-references-preserved-names-snapshotted)) handling.
- Locale-aware serialization conventions ([Decision 8](#decision-8-locale-specific-serialization-with-multilingual-embeddings)).
- The self-sufficiency principle ([Decision 1](#decision-1-cqrs-pattern--separate-read-store-from-transactional-database)).

**Cross-cutting field contract.** Every module-contributed document must include the same cross-cutting fields that core-type documents include: `patient_uuid`, `resource_type`, `resource_uuid`, `record_date`, `last_modified`, `text`, `embedding`, and where applicable `location_uuid` / `location_name`, `provider_uuid` / `provider_name`, `encounter_uuid`, `visit_uuid`, `form_uuid` / `form_name`, and `encounter_type_uuid` / `encounter_type_name`. Modules may add as many type-specific fields as they need beyond these. The cross-cutting set is non-negotiable — without it, cross-type queries break, and `last_modified` specifically is what makes the backend's [Decision 3](#decision-3-pluggable-backend-spi-with-three-reference-implementations) conditional-upsert guard work for module-contributed types under the same race conditions as core types.

**Cross-type query convention.** Consumers needing unified retrieval query the `querystore_*` wildcard pattern. This was already permitted by [Decision 4](#decision-4-per-type-indices-over-a-single-index); promoting it to the official cross-type contract is part of this decision. Per-type queries continue to use the specific index name. Embedding-based queries against the wildcard work because every contributing module embeds via the same pipeline (next point).

**Embedding model contract for query-time consumers.** Because querystore embeds at index time with a single model ([Decision 8](#decision-8-locale-specific-serialization-with-multilingual-embeddings)), every consumer that issues kNN queries must embed its query with the same model. Mismatched models produce incomparable vectors and silently broken results. The embedding model identifier is therefore part of querystore's public contract, surfaced through the SPI for consumers that need it.

### Rationale
1. **Mirrors [Decision 2](#decision-2-module-not-core) one level down.** Just as core should not depend on every module that records clinical data, querystore should not depend on every module that wants to index it. The contribution model lets modules participate without entangling the indexer.
2. **Avoids coupling explosion.** A monolithic querystore becomes a chokepoint for every module's release cycle. The SPI lets modules ship new resource types independently as long as they meet the contract.
3. **Preserves existing decisions uniformly.** Embedding model, locale, voiding, retirement, self-sufficiency — all apply to module-contributed types via the SPI. No parallel rules; the SPI is the surface that enforces existing rules on extension data.
4. **Wildcard cross-type retrieval is already cheap.** Per-type indices made cross-type retrieval inexpensive from the start ([Decision 4](#decision-4-per-type-indices-over-a-single-index)). Modules contributing new indices automatically join the cross-type query surface with no consumer code change.

### Implementation notes

The SPI is the single interface `org.openmrs.module.querystore.spi.ResourceTypeProvider`. A providing module declares a Spring bean implementing this interface in its own `moduleApplicationContext.xml`; querystore discovers all such beans via `Context.getRegisteredComponents(ResourceTypeProvider.class)` at bootstrap time, so a providing module installed after querystore is picked up without restart.

```java
public interface ResourceTypeProvider {
    String getResourceType();                   // <moduleid>_<type>
    ClinicalRecordSerializer<?> getSerializer();
    TypeBootstrapper<?> getBootstrapper();      // nullable
}
```

The interface bundles three things and only three things — the resource-type name, the serializer that builds a `QueryDocument` from a domain entity (the cross-cutting field contract above is the serializer's contract), and an optional `TypeBootstrapper` for historical backfill. A null bootstrapper is legal for types whose first record post-dates module install.

**Indexing trigger lives in the providing module.** A provider does not declare its event subscriptions or AOP advice through the SPI. The module subclasses `org.openmrs.module.querystore.bridge.AbstractIndexingAdvice` and wires it as AOP advice on its own service, mirroring how core-type advice is wired in querystore. The `querystore.bridge.indexer` and `querystore.bridge.dispatcher` beans are reachable via `Context.getRegisteredComponent(...)` so providers reuse the embed-then-upsert after-commit pipeline without re-implementing it. AOP is a time-bound migration bridge per [Decision 12](#decision-12-sync-mechanism--events-first-aop-as-last-resort-gap-filler); when events-first sync ships, the SPI grows an event-subscription hook and the AOP path retires alongside the core-type advice.

**Name validation isolates malformed providers.** Querystore validates each provider's resource type via `ResourceTypeNames.validateProvided` (regex enforcing `<moduleid>_<type>` segments, no consecutive underscores, no leading/trailing underscores) and rejects collisions with the unprefixed core names (`obs`, `encounter`, `visit`, `patient`, `condition`, `diagnosis`, `allergy`, `drug_order`, `test_order`, `referral_order`, `medication_dispense`, `program`). A bad name is logged and the offending provider is skipped at discovery time — one malformed bean does not abort discovery for well-formed peers, mirroring `bootstrap()`'s per-type isolation. The same envelope catches throwing accessors, duplicate names, and serializer/provider resource-type drift. Four of the twelve core names contain underscores and would otherwise match the regex, so the reserved-set check is load-bearing, not redundant.

**Backends self-heal on first write.** All three reference backends call `ensureSchema` lazily on the first upsert per resource type, and the MySQL tier stores all type-specific fields in a single `metadata_json` column ([Decision 3](#decision-3-pluggable-backend-spi-with-three-reference-implementations)). A provider therefore declares no `SchemaSpec`, no Liquibase changesets, and no per-tier mapping — the structured surface is uniform across providers and core types.

**Run order: core first, providers after.** `BootstrapServiceImpl` iterates core bootstrappers (in their configured order, ending in obs) and then providers (in the order Spring returns them). Deferring providers until after the long-running core obs scan is the wrong default in theory but right in practice: providers tend to be small (appointments, billing) and core obs dwarfs them, so what gets delayed by ordering is small to begin with and what gets prioritised by ordering is the slowest scan.

**Worked example for provider authors.** [`docs/spi-providers.md`](spi-providers.md) is the step-by-step walkthrough — serializer, bootstrapper, AOP advice, provider bean, Spring wiring, post-install backfill convention. The walkthrough is verified by `ProviderEndToEndTest`, which builds a `billing_bill` provider from scratch and asserts discovery, prefixed-index routing, cross-type search, patient-scoped retrieval, and patient cascade.

### Criteria for contributing a metadata resource type
The mechanics above make it cheap to register a `ResourceTypeProvider` for any OpenMRS type, including types extending `BaseOpenmrsMetadata`. That does not make every metadata type a good candidate. A module should contribute a metadata `ResourceTypeProvider` *if and only if* the type carries free-text content where embedding/semantic recall delivers materially better results than:

- structured SQL queries against the transactional DB *or* a downstream analytical projection like MambaETL where deployed (filters by tag, type, department, "never referenced" via `LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL` / `NOT IN (...)`, aggregations, cohort definitions, time-series), or
- the denormalized `*_uuid + *_name` already present on clinical-data documents per [Decision 9](#decision-9-coded-fields--store-both-uuid-and-name).

Two corollaries follow:

1. **Missing-data queries are not querystore's job.** Questions of the form "drugs never prescribed," "BillableService never billed," "forms not yet used," or "locations with no encounters this year" are negation queries best served by the transactional DB or a downstream analytical projection (MambaETL where deployed). Embedding similarity does not help find absences; the SQL idiom (`LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL`, `NOT IN (...)`) is both cheaper and more expressive.
2. **Clinical-content discovery in actively-used catalogs is often covered by obs.** "Which forms collect family-planning method?" can be answered by querying obs whose concept semantically matches FP method and grouping by `encounter.form_id`. Indexing the catalog itself is justified only when the catalog carries text, locale synonyms, code mappings, or relationships that obs documents do not propagate.

Types that pass the criterion in practice tend to share three properties: rich free-text fields beyond the canonical name (descriptions, locale synonyms, indications, code-system mappings); a search surface where users phrase queries in terms that do not appear in the canonical name; and a deployment-specific shape that upstream services (OCL, FHIR `$lookup`, public terminology browsers) cannot answer because they do not see local state. The concept dictionary is the largest candidate that meets all three — see the [Knowledge-base and reference-data projection](#knowledge-base-and-reference-data-projection) open question for that case and the OCL/FHIR delegation default that gates it.

### Consequences
- Modules wanting to contribute clinical data depend on querystore (transitively or directly). Deployments that don't install querystore lose any module-contributed indexing — same property as [Decision 2](#decision-2-module-not-core)'s "not every deployment needs it" applied recursively.
- A module rename (changing its moduleid) would require re-creating its index under the new name and re-syncing. Moduleid changes are rare and disruptive in OpenMRS generally, so this is an acceptable consequence of using moduleid for namespacing rather than a separate, mutable identifier.
- The cross-cutting field contract creates a documentation obligation for every contributing module: their docs must specify which cross-cutting fields are populated and which are intentionally null.
- Module developers gain access to the embedding pipeline without having to re-implement it; they also inherit the rules and cannot, for example, retain voided records or pick a different embedding model. This is a feature, not a constraint.
- Consumers of querystore (UIs, AI/analytics tools) can rely on a single retrieval surface for every patient-scoped clinical type in the deployment, regardless of which module recorded the data.

## Decision 14: Authorization and Consumer API Surface

### Status
Accepted

### Context
The ADR specifies what is indexed and how data flows in, but says nothing about how consumers reach the index or how access is controlled. The two questions are coupled: where authorization checks run depends on what surface consumers hit. Picking an authorization model in isolation requires either silently picking an interface or pretending one doesn't exist.

The chartsearchai migration ([migration-chartsearchai.md](./migration-chartsearchai.md)) makes this concrete. chartsearchai today enforces an "AI Query Patient Data" privilege plus core's per-patient access checks. Without an authorization model on the querystore side, a migration either pushes those checks onto every consumer (fragile, easy to forget) or runs unauthenticated queries against patient data — the leakage failure mode the original Authorization open question flagged.

### Decision
1. **Primary consumer surface for v1 is a Java service** (`QueryStoreService`) running in-process inside the OpenMRS JVM. The backend (Elasticsearch, embedded Lucene, or MySQL — see [Decision 3](#decision-3-pluggable-backend-spi-with-three-reference-implementations)) is internal infrastructure; consumers never query it directly. REST, FHIR Search, and other HTTP-fronted surfaces are out of v1 scope but explicitly additive — they layer on top of the same Java service and apply the same enforcement boundary at their own entry points.

2. **Authorization is declared on the service interface via `@Authorized` annotations.** Read methods on `QueryStoreService` carry OpenMRS's `@Authorized` annotation naming the required privilege; core's `AuthorizationAdvice` AOP enforces it before the method body runs and throws `APIAuthenticationException` when the caller lacks it. v1 read methods (`search`, `searchByPatient`, `getPatientChart`) require `PrivilegeConstants.GET_PATIENTS` — the same privilege `PatientService.getPatient` requires. Per-patient post-filtering is *not* applied in v1 — see consequences. (`getPatientChart` is the unfiltered full-chart variant introduced by [Decision 15](#decision-15-full-chart-retrieval--unfiltered-per-patient-enumeration).)

3. **Querystore does not invent its own privilege scheme.** Privilege names follow OpenMRS conventions; deployments configure access through core's role and privilege management. Specialised privileges — chartsearchai's "AI Query Patient Data" being the canonical example — are deployment-defined, assigned to roles in core, and required by *consumers* before they invoke querystore. Querystore enforces what core would enforce on the equivalent direct call; it does not introduce parallel authorization concepts.

4. **The contract is "no result a core API would refuse."** Any document returned by querystore must be one the authenticated caller could have read via core's APIs. If a deployment's policy denies the caller access to certain records (sensitive obs, restricted patients), querystore must not surface those documents. The mechanism — pre-filter the ES query, post-filter the results, or denormalise sensitivity labels into documents — is implementation choice; the contract is binding.

### Rationale
1. **Java service mirrors how OpenMRS modules are normally consumed.** `Context.getService(QueryStoreService.class)` already exists and is what `moduleApplicationContext.xml` wires. Picking it as the v1 surface means consumers integrate the same way they integrate every other OpenMRS service.
2. **`@Authorized` is the OpenMRS-idiomatic pattern.** Every other OpenMRS service declares its privilege requirements this way. Putting the contract on the interface makes it visible to consumers, eliminates imperative auth code in the impl that someone could forget to add to a new method, and lets core's existing AOP advice do the enforcement.
3. **Reusing core's privilege constants avoids divergence.** A bespoke auth model — querystore-specific privilege names, a dedicated permission service — would drift from core over time. Annotating with `PrivilegeConstants.GET_PATIENTS` means any change core makes to that privilege's name or semantics applies to querystore automatically.
4. **Deferring REST / FHIR keeps v1 small without precluding them.** The Java service is the minimal surface chartsearchai needs to migrate. Adding a REST layer later is a controller that authenticates the request (session token, OAuth, whatever the deployment uses) and dispatches to the same `QueryStoreService` — the auth boundary already exists, the new layer routes to it.
5. **Cross-patient search relying on a coarse privilege matches existing practice.** chartsearchai's "AI Query Patient Data" privilege is a coarse gate, not a per-patient check. Adopting the same coarse model for querystore's cross-patient search keeps the migration straightforward and matches operational reality: deployments granting AI/analytics access already trust those callers at the patient-set level.

### Consequences
- **Cross-patient search results may include patients the caller cannot read individually via core.** Coarse `GET_PATIENTS` gates the query; per-result patient-access filtering is not enforced in v1. Deployments needing finer cross-patient enforcement must either restrict who holds the privilege or add post-filtering in their consumer. A follow-up decision can revisit this once a real use case forces the trade-off.
- **Per-patient access modules (`dataFilter`, location-based ACLs, etc.) are not honoured by v1's enforcement.** `@Authorized` runs the static privilege check; it does not invoke a Hibernate-level patient read, so any per-patient filtering those modules add does not fire. Deployments that rely on such modules need either an explicit hook in querystore (a v2 decision) or consumer-side enforcement.
- **Sensitive-data access policy is binding but its mechanism is unspecified.** v1 implementations may pre-filter the ES query (faster), post-filter the results (simpler), or denormalise sensitivity labels into documents (most efficient, most invasive). The contract — no result a core API would refuse on the same privilege grant — holds regardless of mechanism. A future decision may pin one approach if multiple implementations diverge or an audit obligation requires it.
- **Indexing methods (`index`, `delete`) are not `@Authorized`-gated in v1.** They are invoked by the sync pipeline running in a system context. Hardening that surface — either by splitting it onto a sync-only interface or adding a `Manage Querystore`-class privilege — is deferred to v2.
- **External consumers (non-JVM, non-OpenMRS) cannot integrate in v1.** Any such consumer requires a REST or FHIR surface, which is deferred. This is explicitly a v1 limitation, not a permanent one.
- **Audit logging of querystore queries is not mandated by this decision.** Audit (who searched for what, when) is an adjacent concern; it should be addressed by a separate decision if it surfaces as a real requirement.

## Decision 15: Full-Chart Retrieval — Unfiltered Per-Patient Enumeration

### Status
Accepted

### Context
[Decision 14](#decision-14-authorization-and-consumer-api-surface) enumerates two v1 read methods, `search` and `searchByPatient`, both of which apply hybrid (BM25 + kNN) ranking against a query string and cap results with a `limit`. That shape fits the retrieve-relevant-snippets-for-a-question use case the chartsearchai migration's adaptive filtering stack consumes.

It does not fit the second use case chartsearchai also exercises: **passing a patient's entire chart to an LLM without question-conditioned filtering.** chartsearchai today handles that path with a separate `ChartCache` / `ChartCacheInvalidator` pair that serializes records by walking core via `PatientRecordLoader`, caches the assembled text per patient, and invalidates on writes. The [chartsearchai port map](./chartsearchai-port-map.md) classified that cache as "orthogonal to the read store" on the assumption that full-chart assembly was a live core read.

Now that querystore serializes every clinical record into per-type indices via the events-first sync pipeline ([Decision 12](#decision-12-sync-mechanism--events-first-aop-as-last-resort-gap-filler)), that assumption no longer holds. The patient's serialized chart already exists in `querystore_*` indices keyed by `patient_uuid`. Returning all of it is enumeration over an already-materialized projection — not a relevance query. Leaving the full-chart path to a consumer-side cache forces chartsearchai (and any future LLM-reasoning consumer) to maintain a parallel serialization pipeline duplicating the work querystore already performs, in direct conflict with [Decision 1](#decision-1-cqrs-pattern--separate-read-store-from-transactional-database)'s self-sufficiency principle.

### Decision
1. **A third v1 read method, `getPatientChart(patientUuid)`, returns every indexed document for the patient with no relevance ranking and no caller-supplied limit.** Signature: `List<QueryDocument> getPatientChart(String patientUuid)`. There is no `query` parameter — relevance filtering is the explicit non-goal — and there is no `limit` parameter on the call. Callers receive the full set or, in cold-bootstrap edge cases, an empty list (see below). A tier-specific cap applies on the Elasticsearch backend per the Consequences section below; MySQL and Lucene are unbounded.

2. **Authorization mirrors `searchByPatient`.** The method carries `@Authorized(PrivilegeConstants.GET_PATIENTS)` — identical to `searchByPatient`, identical to `PatientService.getPatient`. The full-chart payload is the same patient-scoped clinical data that already passes that gate; widening (e.g., a dedicated "Read Full Chart" privilege) would invent a parallel authorization concept [Decision 14](#decision-14-authorization-and-consumer-api-surface) explicitly rejects. The Decision 14 contract — "no result a core API would refuse on the equivalent direct call" — applies unchanged: any sensitive-data filtering a deployment denies on `GET_PATIENTS` must also be honoured here.

3. **Documents are returned in `record_date` descending order, ties broken deterministically by `(resource_type, resource_uuid)`.** Reverse-chronological matches chartsearchai's existing recency-cap prompt-assembly convention and gives consumers a stable starting order if they truncate to fit an LLM context window. The tie-breaker keeps two records sharing a timestamp from reshuffling between calls. Consumers that want a different order (grouped by `resource_type`, chronological ascending, etc.) sort the returned list — the service does not expose ordering parameters in v1.

4. **Cold-patient lazy bootstrap behaviour is identical to `searchByPatient`.** When no documents exist for `patientUuid`, the call synchronously projects that patient via `BootstrapService.ensureIndexed(patientUuid)` before returning, per the [Initial backfill / bootstrap](#initial-backfill--bootstrap) open question's lazy-projection convention. First touch on a never-indexed patient pays the same one-time serialization-plus-embedding cost; subsequent calls hit the steady-state path.

5. **No pagination, no streaming, no token-budget awareness in v1.** Consumers receive a `List<QueryDocument>` materialized in memory. Token budgeting, recency truncation, and prompt-window fitting are explicitly consumer concerns — they live in the prompt-assembly layer above querystore, exactly where chartsearchai keeps them today.

### Rationale
1. **The data is already serialized; not exposing it forces consumers to re-serialize.** Every record in `querystore_*` was produced by the same per-type serializers the LLM consumer wants to feed its prompt with. A consumer-side `ChartCache` would re-walk core through `PatientRecordLoader`, run the same locale-aware concept-name resolution, and end up with the same labeled-prose text the read store already holds. CQRS self-sufficiency ([Decision 1](#decision-1-cqrs-pattern--separate-read-store-from-transactional-database)) makes that duplication a smell.
2. **The shape — enumerate by `patient_uuid` — is a primitive every backend already supports.** Each backend tier ([Decision 3](#decision-3-pluggable-backend-spi-with-three-reference-implementations)) already filters by `patient_uuid` to implement `searchByPatient` and `bulkDeleteByPatient`. A no-query, no-limit variant is a thinner call than `searchByPatient`, not a new capability — it skips the ranking layer entirely. Implementation cost is bounded.
3. **Same privilege as `searchByPatient` avoids access-control drift.** Anyone who can run a ranked search against a patient's chart can already retrieve every document by issuing successive empty-ish queries with large limits. Introducing a separate privilege for the convenience method would create a paper distinction the underlying API cannot enforce.
4. **Reverse-chronological is the right default for the dominant consumer.** chartsearchai's recency cap, the LLM-reasoning use case, and the typical "most recent first" UI pattern all converge on `record_date` descending. Picking a different convention (e.g., grouped by `resource_type`) would force the dominant consumer to re-sort.
5. **No pagination keeps v1 honest about what this method is for.** A consumer that needs paginated chart browsing is doing something other than full-context LLM reasoning — it should use `searchByPatient` with appropriate query construction or wait for a paginated v2 variant. Bolting pagination onto v1 invites consumers to use this method as a paginated record browser, which would create pressure to add filtering, ordering, and aggregation parameters that are exactly the relevance-ranking surface this method is defined *against*.

### Consequences
- **chartsearchai removes `ChartCache` and `ChartCacheInvalidator` on migration.** The [chartsearchai port map](./chartsearchai-port-map.md)'s "orthogonal to the read store" classification of those two classes is superseded by this decision: the full-chart path becomes a `getPatientChart` call, and the cache+invalidator are replaced by querystore's existing index + sync pipeline.
- **Unbounded result size is a real operational concern, paid by the consumer.** A patient with a decade of vitals can produce thousands of documents totalling megabytes of text. v1's contract is "we return what's indexed"; downstream token-budget enforcement, streaming-to-LLM, or per-resource-type recency caps belong in the consumer. Operators noticing memory pressure from this method should treat it as a signal to add consumer-side limits, not to add limits to the service.
- **ES tier carries a v1 single-call cap of 10 000 hits, inherited from `max_result_window`.** MySQL and Lucene stream from JDBC / Lucene directly and honour the unbounded contract natively. The ES tier issues a single `_search` with `size=10000` sorted by `record_date` desc, so any truncation keeps the most-recent slice and logs a warning. PIT + `search_after` pagination to lift the cap is the v1.1 follow-up if a real consumer ever crosses it; the LLM consumer the decision is designed for tops out at context-window size long before 10k docs.
- **First-touch latency on never-indexed patients matches `searchByPatient`.** The lazy-bootstrap side effect ([Initial backfill / bootstrap](#initial-backfill--bootstrap)) applies identically. Deployments wanting predictable response on every call run the global scan or schedule periodic backfills — the lazy path remains the safety net.
- **Sensitive-data filtering from [Decision 14](#decision-14-authorization-and-consumer-api-surface) applies unchanged.** Whatever mechanism a deployment uses to exclude sensitive obs or restricted patients from `searchByPatient` must also exclude them here. The full-chart payload is not an authorization loophole.
- **Per-type pagination, streaming, or filtered variants are deferred to v2.** If a real consumer surfaces (e.g., a non-LLM "browse all records" UI that genuinely cannot fit everything in memory), a future decision can introduce `getPatientChart(patientUuid, Pageable)` or a streaming variant. v1 deliberately does not predict that consumer.
- **The Decision 14 v1 read surface grows from two methods to three.** This is the additive expansion Decision 14 explicitly accommodates ("REST, FHIR Search, and other HTTP-fronted surfaces are out of v1 scope but explicitly additive — they layer on top of the same Java service"); the same shape applies to additional in-process read methods. Any future surface (REST/FHIR) wraps all three methods uniformly.

### Initial backfill / bootstrap
[Decision 12](#decision-12-sync-mechanism--events-first-aop-as-last-resort-gap-filler) covers steady-state sync but not how the read store reaches "in sync" the first time, after a full rebuild, or after adding a new indexed resource type to an existing deployment. Likely shape: a one-time service-API scan that paginates through every entity of each type, serializes it, generates embeddings, and writes through index aliases. Decision needed on chunking strategy, throttling to avoid overloading core, embedding-generation throughput, progress tracking, and how the steady-state event subscription is started without missing events emitted during the backfill window.

**Lazy per-patient projection.** A second mode of the bootstrap path, distinct from the global scan: `QueryStoreService.searchByPatient` for a patient with zero indexed documents synchronously projects that patient's clinical data inline, then re-runs the search. The shared primitive is a `BootstrapService.ensureIndexed(patientUuid)` method that composes the existing per-type serializers, embedding pipeline, and version-protected write path — scoped to a single patient instead of walking every record of a type. Targeted at deployments without scheduled backfill (chartsearchai's demo server at `chartsearchai.openmrs.org` is the motivating case): a first-touch query against a never-indexed patient would otherwise silently return nothing.

This sits in tension with [Decision 1](#decision-1-cqrs-pattern--separate-read-store-from-transactional-database)'s self-sufficiency principle. The principle prohibits *read-side* fallback to core when a query pattern isn't indexed; lazy per-patient projection is a *write-side* materialization triggered by a read. The distinction is real (we're indexing, not querying core for results), but the user-visible effect — a slow first search because of inline core work — is the same shape of latency cost the principle warns about. The ADR accepts this exception explicitly, scoped to first-touch-per-patient and paid only once per patient lifetime. Deployments that want predictable read latency run the global scan or schedule periodic backfills; the lazy path is the safety net for the rest.

Sub-questions:
- **Idempotency.** Repeated lazy-fill calls for the same patient must not double-project. `BackendStore.existsByPatient(patientUuid)` is the cheap pre-check in `searchByPatient`; a per-patient JVM lock guards the in-flight window. `PatientBootstrapper` projects the Patient document itself (name, identifiers) on the first call, so even a patient with zero clinical data flips `existsByPatient` to true after lazy-fill — no re-trigger on subsequent searches.
- **Failure semantics.** Per-record and per-type failures inside `ensureIndexed` are isolated and logged, mirroring the per-type bootstrap's skip-on-failure pattern. A partial projection is acceptable: whatever landed is searchable. Top-level failure of `ensureIndexed` must not block search — empty results are the same outcome as before the feature shipped. The exception is a *page-fetch* failure — a dangling FK that Hibernate eager-materializes during the paginated `q.list()`, which throws before per-record isolation runs and so fails the whole type; the inner-join guard under **Dump-orphaned foreign keys** below prevents the common cases.
- **Concurrency primitive.** A per-patient JVM lock map on `BootstrapServiceImpl` mirrors the existing per-resource-type lock. Cross-JVM races between two nodes lazy-filling the same patient are absorbed by the [Decision 3](#decision-3-pluggable-backend-spi-with-three-reference-implementations) version invariant (conditional upsert on `last_modified`); the lock prevents redundant work, not correctness.
- **Latency on first search.** A patient with hundreds of obs takes seconds to embed (CPU-bound on the local embedder). `searchByPatient` blocks for that duration on first touch. Consumers needing sub-second response on every call must pre-bootstrap. A future open question may explore async kickoff or bounded-timeout variants if the inline cost becomes operationally visible.
- **Relationship to an explicit `ensureIndexed` consumer surface.** A complementary feature ([issue #5](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-querystore/issues/5)) exposes `ensureIndexed` directly to consumers for warmup flows. Both back onto the same `BootstrapService` primitive.

**On-demand global reindex trigger (no-restart).** The global scan otherwise starts only at module startup (the `querystore.bootstrap.autostart` GP, read once in `QueryStoreActivator.started()`). On an already-running, SQL-dump-seeded instance — `chartsearchai.openmrs.org` is again the motivating case — there was no way to launch the backfill without a restart, even with the autostart GP set, which is precisely the gap operators hit. `POST /ws/rest/v1/querystore/reindex {"scope":"all"}` (gated by `Manage Global Properties`) now launches `BootstrapService.bootstrap()` on a daemon thread and returns `202 Accepted`; operators poll `GET /querystore/indexingstatus` to `complete:true`. The endpoint *overloads* the existing per-patient reindex rather than adding a second route, and the global scope is opt-in via an explicit `scope:"all"` — not "absent `patient` means everything", since absence overlaps with a malformed request and resolving that ambiguity by launching the most expensive operation in the module is a footgun. `BootstrapLauncher` is the single daemon-thread launch path shared by autostart and the endpoint (it returns `false` when no `DaemonToken` is wired, so neither caller spawns a context-less thread); concurrent launches are safe via the per-resource-type locks. This realises the "async kickoff" direction flagged under *Latency on first search* above, for the global scope.

**Dump-orphaned foreign keys (poison-page resilience).** A SQL-dump–seeded deployment (`chartsearchai.openmrs.org` again the motivating case) can carry rows whose *mandatory* foreign key points at a row the dump omitted — FK checks are disabled during import, so referential integrity is not enforced. The paginated bootstrap fetch (`HibernateTypeBootstrapper.fetchPage`) eager-materializes a record's to-one associations during `q.list()`, so one orphan throws Hibernate's `FetchNotFoundException` *at page fetch* — before `TypeBootstrapper.projectOne`'s per-record skip (see *Failure semantics* above) can isolate it — and fails the **entire resource type**, indexing zero of N records. Observed on the demo: the `diagnosis` type FAILED with "Encounter 767 does not exist" (a dump-orphaned `encounter_diagnosis` row pointing at a missing `encounter`). **Convention:** drop the orphan at the SQL level by navigating the association in the WHERE clause (`AND <assoc>.uuid IS NOT NULL`), which forces an inner join that excludes the dangling row before it is materialized. Applied unconditionally to the patient/person scope (every indexable record is patient-scoped, and an orphaned patient FK is unindexable anyway), and per-type to additional **mandatory** (`optional=false` / `not-null`) eager to-one associations a type declares via `HibernateTypeBootstrapper.additionalNonNullExprs()` — currently `e.encounter.uuid` on `Diagnosis` and the three `Order` subtypes (`DrugOrder`/`TestOrder`/`ReferralOrder`), whose `encounter` is mandatory + eager. Restricting the guard to *mandatory* associations is what keeps it from dropping a legitimately-null one; it runs on both the global scan and the per-patient (`ensureIndexed`/`reindexPatient`) scan. **Residuals (not covered by this mechanism):** a *nullable* association with a non-null-but-dangling FK (e.g. `Condition`/`Allergy`/`Obs` encounter) and a dangling mandatory *metadata* FK (e.g. `Obs.concept`) would still fail their type the same way — the `IS NOT NULL` guard can't address the first (it would drop legitimately-null rows) and is deferred for the second (metadata is dumped wholesale, so orphan risk is low). The general fix for both is to catch the page-fetch failure and fall back to per-row fetching that skips poison rows — the same remediation direction as [Sync reliability and reconciliation](#sync-reliability-and-reconciliation). The orphaned record itself stays unindexed until the underlying data is repaired (delete the orphan row, or restore the missing parent).

### Sync reliability and reconciliation
The Event module can lose events on broker restart, and consumer-side failures can drop messages even when delivery succeeded. [Decision 12](#decision-12-sync-mechanism--events-first-aop-as-last-resort-gap-filler) acknowledges this without solving it. Decision needed on: durable subscription configuration, dead-letter handling for permanently-failing events, periodic reconciliation (e.g., per-patient or per-type record-count comparisons against core to detect drift), and a remediation path when drift is detected (targeted re-sync vs. full rebuild). Related to but distinct from the bootstrap question above.

**Direction being implemented — count-based drift detection (read-only).** The first concrete step toward reconciliation is *detection*, decoupled from remediation. Per resource type, compare two counts:
- **`coreCount`** — records in core's transactional DB that the scan *visits*. Defined as the bootstrap scan's own WHERE: `voided = false`, patient/person guard non-null, and each `additionalNonNullExprs()` guard non-null (see the dump-orphaned-FK guard above). Exposed as `TypeBootstrapper.countIndexable()`; `HibernateTypeBootstrapper` runs `SELECT count(e) FROM <Entity> e WHERE <same guards>`. Computing it from the same guards is deliberate: a record the guard *legitimately* excludes (a true orphan) is not visited, so it doesn't show as drift — but a record the bootstrap *skipped* (a poison row, a lost event, an incomplete scan) or that arrived post-bootstrap *does*. **`coreCount` is an upper bound on `indexedCount`, not an exact target:** the serializer legitimately returns `null` for some visited records (obs group parents whose members carry the data, value-less diagnoses), which are counted here but never indexed. So a small, stable per-type positive drift is expected baseline — the actionable signal is a *large or growing* gap, not merely non-zero drift. (A future refinement could subtract a per-type null-serialize baseline, or compare against the bootstrap's own `documents_indexed` tally; for v1 the raw gap with documented baseline is the detection signal.)
- **`indexedCount`** — live documents in the backend's per-type store. Exposed as `BackendStore.countByType(resourceType)`: a `default` returning `-1` ("unknown" — so a backend or test double that doesn't implement it degrades to "drift not computable" rather than breaking), overridden per tier — MySQL `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM querystore_<type>` (absent table → 0), Lucene `IndexSearcher.count(MatchAllDocs)` (absent index → 0), Elasticsearch `_count` (404 → 0).

`drift = coreCount − indexedCount` (positive = under-indexed, the common case; negative = stale extras, e.g. records voided/deleted in core but not yet evented out). Computed **on demand** (a COUNT per type across ~12 core types is cheap), not persisted in progress rows, and surfaced via a new admin-gated `GET /ws/rest/v1/querystore/drift` endpoint distinct from `indexingstatus` (which stays a light read of progress rows). **Remediation is explicitly out of scope for detection** — once drift is visible, the operator reuses the existing reindex paths (`POST /querystore/reindex {scope:"all"}` for a global rebuild, or per-patient `reindex`); a targeted "re-sync just the drifted type" hook is a later step. This is detection only; durable subscriptions, dead-letter handling, and a periodic/automated reconciliation loop remain open above.

A separate but related concern is direct-database writes (Liquibase migrations, direct SQL) that bypass the Event module entirely. Today these escape both events and AOP and would be caught only by reconciliation. If [TRUNK-6516](https://openmrs.atlassian.net/browse/TRUNK-6516) ships a Debezium-backed Event module, that gap closes at the platform level (see [Decision 12](#decision-12-sync-mechanism--events-first-aop-as-last-resort-gap-filler) rationale point 7), and reconciliation only needs to cover broker-loss and dropped-message cases. Until then, an additional bridging mechanism is needed for module-shipped Liquibase changesets that rewrite indexed data — discussed separately in the [Migration-time re-projection hook](#migration-time-re-projection-hook) open question.

### Migration-time re-projection hook
Modules occasionally ship Liquibase changesets that rewrite data already projected into the read store — backfilling a column, normalising a value set, fixing data corrupted by a prior bug. These writes bypass the OpenMRS Event module entirely (see [Sync reliability and reconciliation](#sync-reliability-and-reconciliation) above), so the read store does not learn about them through any sync path other than reconciliation, and reconciliation cycles may run far enough apart that the drift is user-visible in the meantime. Closing this gap before [TRUNK-6516](https://openmrs.atlassian.net/browse/TRUNK-6516) lands needs an explicit declaration mechanism: a module that touches indexed data tells querystore at startup which resource types it affected, and querystore re-projects those types (or, more precisely, the affected records within them). The design surface includes:
- **Trigger surface.** How does a module declare the affected scope — an annotation on the Liquibase changeset, a manifest file, an OpenMRS module config property, or a service interface the module implements? Likely an extension of the [Decision 13](#decision-13-module-extension-spi-service-provider-interface-for-custom-resource-types) SPI rather than a parallel mechanism.
- **Lifecycle.** Run once after the changeset applies, or every startup until the module acknowledges completion?
- **Scope granularity.** Resource types only (re-project everything of that type), or row-level (UUIDs of specifically touched records)? Row-level is dramatically cheaper but pushes more work onto the module.
- **Idempotency.** A module redeclaring the same scope across multiple startups should not trigger redundant re-projection.
- **Failure handling.** A re-projection failure during startup: block the module from starting, mark drift as known and continue, or retry on a schedule?
- **Discovery.** How does querystore find these declarations across all installed modules without each module having to register imperatively?

This open question is moot if [TRUNK-6516](https://openmrs.atlassian.net/browse/TRUNK-6516) ships and the OpenMRS Event module emits events for direct-DB writes. Until then, it is the bridge between "events miss this" and "reconciliation eventually catches this."

### Event-handler idempotency and ordering
[Decision 12](#decision-12-sync-mechanism--events-first-aop-as-last-resort-gap-filler) selects a JMS-backed at-least-once delivery model, which permits duplicate delivery (the same update event handled twice) and out-of-order delivery (a void event arriving before the corresponding create, or two updates applied in the wrong order). Distinct from the lost-events concern above: those are events that never arrive; these are events that arrive too many times or in the wrong sequence. Decision needed on: idempotency strategy for each handler (delete-by-uuid is naturally idempotent, but updates and merges are not), how to detect and discard stale updates (e.g., compare an event timestamp or version against the indexed document), and what to do when a void or update arrives for a `resource_uuid` not yet present in the read store (drop, queue for retry, or fetch-and-create from core).

The out-of-order-updates sub-concern is partially addressed by the [Decision 3](#decision-3-pluggable-backend-spi-with-three-reference-implementations) conditional-upsert-by-version invariant: handlers re-fetch the entity from core and write the resulting document with the entity's current `dateChanged`/`dateCreated` as `last_modified`; the backend drops writes whose version is older than what's stored. Two updates handled in the wrong order converge on the freshest document regardless of arrival order. Still open: void-before-create handling, payload-staleness vs. fetch-staleness (handler reads core, but core may itself have advanced further by then), and stale-delete arriving after a fresh recreate.

### Embedding model versioning
[Decision 8](#decision-8-locale-specific-serialization-with-multilingual-embeddings) specifies a model class (multilingual-e5) but not a specific model identifier or upgrade path. Embeddings from different models are not comparable, so a model change is a full re-index of every vector. Needs a decision on model pinning, a per-document `embedding_model_version` field, and how model upgrades coordinate with index aliases (see next item).

Text-embedder candidates to evaluate before pinning:

- **multilingual-e5 family** (small/base/large) — the current reference. BERT-class (XLM-RoBERTa), works as-is with the ported `OnnxEmbeddingProvider` + `WordPieceTokenizer`. 512-token context. MIT license. Dual-encoder via `query:`/`passage:` prefixes — already reflected in the SPI's `embed()` / `embedQuery()` split.
- **EmbeddingGemma** (Google, ~308M params) — generally outperforms `multilingual-e5-large` on MTEB multilingual retrieval at roughly half the parameter count. Three properties make it interesting beyond raw quality: a 2048-token context window (materially shrinks the silent-truncation surface that drives *Long-text chunking for embeddings* below, though it does not eliminate it), native Matryoshka representation learning (a single 768-dim model serves 512/256/128-dim consumers without re-embedding, useful as a storage lever for the MySQL tier), and a permissive-but-restricted Gemma license that needs a clinical-deployment legal read. The cost is non-trivial port work: Gemma architecture needs a SentencePiece tokenizer (querystore currently only has WordPiece) and an ONNX export covering RoPE / RMSNorm / GQA. Worth evaluating once a basic indexing path is shipped on the e5/MiniLM-shaped runtime.

Evaluation axes for any text-embedder candidate: retrieval quality on the chartsearchai eval dataset (153 records, query-recall benchmarks), context-window fit against typical clinical obs lengths, runtime port cost against the current ONNX + WordPiece pipeline, license fit for clinical deployment, and inference cost on the deployment hardware footprint querystore targets (CPU-first, no required GPU).

Multimodal model selection (for image / audio embeddings — see *Complex obs handling* below) is a distinct sub-decision under this umbrella, with its own constraint set: shared image-text vector space (CLIP-class architecture, not a generative VLM repurposed as an embedder), multilingual support consistent with Decision 8, license suitable for clinical deployment, and demonstrated performance on medical imagery (X-rays, retinal photos, dermatology) where generic web-trained models routinely underperform. Candidates to evaluate when the time comes include medical-specialized variants (BiomedCLIP, MedCLIP, PubMedCLIP), general CLIP / SigLIP families, and Gemma-derived options (multimodal Gemma, EmbeddingGemma if it ever ships a multimodal variant).

### Long-text chunking for embeddings
Multilingual embedding models have a fixed input window — multilingual-e5 caps at roughly 512 tokens. Clinical notes, discharge summaries, and other narrative text obs values routinely exceed this. [Decision 5](#decision-5-plain-text-serialization-over-json-or-fhir) and [Decision 6](#decision-6-document-model--text-embeddings-and-structured-metadata) assume one text chunk + one embedding per record, which silently fails on long values (the model truncates and the tail of the note is invisible to semantic search). Decision needed on a chunking strategy: parent/child documents in Elasticsearch with chunk-level embeddings rolled up at retrieval, sliding-window chunks, semantic splits, refusing to embed values above a threshold, or some combination. Affects retrieval quality for any unstructured-text obs and should be decided before notes-style data is heavily ingested. Closely tied to *Complex obs handling* below — `LongFreeTextHandler` is exactly the class of long-text values that straddles both questions.

### Complex obs handling
OpenMRS complex obs are observations whose value is produced by a `complexHandler` and stored as a file or stream rather than a primitive — typically images (`ImageHandler`), generic binary (`BinaryDataHandler`, `BinaryStreamHandler`), audio/video (`MediaHandler`), or long narrative text (`LongFreeTextHandler`). The schema now carries `value_complex_uri` + `value_complex_handler` ([Decision 6](#decision-6-document-model--text-embeddings-and-structured-metadata)) so the document records *that* a complex value exists and where to fetch it, but per-handler indexing behavior is not yet specified.

Sub-questions:

- **(a) `LongFreeTextHandler`** — extract the text into `value_text` and apply the long-text chunking strategy above. This is the natural design and the cleanest case.
- **(b) Image / binary / media handlers** — decide whether multimodal embeddings (image-similarity, text-to-image semantic search) are an optional v1 capability or strictly out of v1 scope. The use cases (case-based imaging retrieval, dermatology and retinal screening, cough acoustics) are real and high-value in OpenMRS deployment contexts, but the model-selection risk is non-trivial. See *Embedding model versioning* above for the constraint set: shared vector space, multilingual support, clinical-deployment licensing, performance on medical imagery.
- **(c) Custom handlers** registered by deployments need a documented default — URI reference + handler-name marker, no extraction.
- **(d) Schema future-proofing** — regardless of whether multimodal embeddings are in v1, the schema must not preclude them. Adding `image_embedding` / `audio_embedding` per-modality vector fields later should be additive, not a migration.

A decision should pick the per-handler behavior, the default for unknown handlers, the v1 scope for each modality, and the migration path if multimodal is enabled later.

### Re-index / alias strategy
Multiple decisions ([8](#decision-8-locale-specific-serialization-with-multilingual-embeddings), [11](#decision-11-retired-metadata--data-references-preserved-names-snapshotted), and any future serializer change) imply re-indexing as the remedy. Doing this without downtime requires writing through aliases (e.g., `querystore_obs` → `querystore_obs_v1`, with atomic swap to `_v2` after backfill). No decision covers the alias convention, the cutover protocol, or — given [Decision 12](#decision-12-sync-mechanism--events-first-aop-as-last-resort-gap-filler) — how the live event subscription is coordinated during cutover (events arriving mid-rebuild must land somewhere: dual-write to old and new aliases, replay from a snapshot, or a controlled subscription pause). Several existing claims rely on this being possible. The lighter-weight [Name-refresh re-projection](#name-refresh-re-projection) path below is a per-document partial-update operation and does not strictly require alias cutover, but it shares operational concerns (bounded fan-out throughput, coordination with concurrent event-driven updates, failure recovery) with the full re-index path and is best designed alongside it. Tier migration under [Decision 3](#decision-3-pluggable-backend-spi-with-three-reference-implementations) (e.g., a deployment outgrowing the MySQL tier and switching to Elasticsearch) is structurally a re-index from one backend to another and shares the same coordination problem; the alias convention chosen here should generalise across backends.

### Backend SPI contract — residual
The bulk of the SPI contract — operation surface, hybrid fusion location, score semantics, bulk-write semantics, transactional boundaries, and capability-negotiation mechanism — is now pinned in [Decision 3](#decision-3-pluggable-backend-spi-with-three-reference-implementations) and reflected in the `BackendStore` interface that ships with the MySQL reference implementation. What remains:

- **Aggregations.** The v1 SPI does not expose counts, group-by, or other aggregation primitives. The gating signal for adding `aggregate(...)` is whether downstream consumers (FHIR analytics, reporting modules, [Tier upgrade operational signals](#tier-upgrade-operational-signals)) ask for it concretely. Additive change when it lands.
- **Specific corpus-size thresholds and admin alerting.** Decision 3 commits to the *mechanism* (`BackendCapabilities.recommendedMaxCorpusSize` + service-layer warning), but the documented thresholds ("MySQL not recommended above N", "alert at M") depend on real-corpus measurement and are tracked under [Tier upgrade operational signals](#tier-upgrade-operational-signals).
- **ES write-throughput relaxation.** Decision 3 commits the ES backend to `refresh=wait_for` per call for durability + visibility parity. The eval measured a 142s indexing cost for a 153-record benchmark at default `refresh_interval=1s` — fine for steady-state event sync, painful for bootstrap fan-out. A batched-flush variant (with the latency-vs-staleness contract spelled out, and a bootstrap-mode escape hatch) is the residual question.
- **`bulkDeleteByPatient` accounting under concurrent writes.** ES `_delete_by_query` with `Conflicts.Proceed` separately counts `version_conflicts` (documents matched by the query but skipped because their version changed mid-scroll). These count toward `total` but not toward `deleted` or per-doc `failures`. The current `ElasticsearchBackendStore.bulkDeleteByPatient` therefore reports `totalRequested - succeeded > failures.size()` as a legitimate but unexplained outcome when a concurrent writer touches the patient's docs mid-cascade. v1 use cases (patient merge, void cascade) have no such concurrent writer, but the SPI's `BulkWriteResult` should pin whether `version_conflicts` surface as `DocFailure` entries with `retryable=true`, as a separate counter, or stay silent on the assumption the call is run in a quiesced window. Affects only the ES tier; Lucene and MySQL have no analogous skip path.

### Zero-vector embedding handling across tiers
Elasticsearch's `dense_vector` with `similarity: cosine` rejects zero-magnitude vectors at parse time — a write with an all-zeros embedding fails with a mapper-parsing exception that surfaces as `WriteResult.failed`. The MySQL and Lucene tiers accept the bytes regardless and produce a `0/0` cosine score at query time (both use brute-force in-process scan over stored bytes; neither runs through Lucene's native HNSW validator). The SPI does not yet say what callers should expect when a record happens to embed to all zeros: accept and store regardless (current MySQL behavior, no kNN signal), reject pre-flight on every tier so behavior is uniform, drop the embedding silently and index the rest of the document, or fail loudly with a typed exception. The current `OnnxEmbeddingProvider` with multilingual-e5 / MiniLM produces L2-normalised vectors that should never be all zeros in practice, but the SPI contract is the right place to pin behavior so the divergence does not surface only as a write failure on the ES tier under an unusual input. Surfaced during the Elasticsearch backend integration tests where a test fixture using `new float[N]` tripped the ES validator while passing on Lucene and MySQL.

### Tier upgrade operational signals
[Decision 3](#decision-3-pluggable-backend-spi-with-three-reference-implementations) makes tier migration cheap structurally (config change + re-index from core) but does not specify *when* a deployment should upgrade. A deployment that installs on the default `mysql` tier and indexes a million obs over six months will hit query-latency degradation gradually; without operational signals, the upgrade decision is reactive (clinicians complain about slow searches) rather than proactive. Decision needed on:

- **Metrics to expose.** Per-query latency percentiles, corpus size by resource type, brute-force kNN scan size — what does querystore surface for ops to observe? At a minimum, the metrics that distinguish "this tier is healthy" from "this tier is degrading" must be exposed cheaply.
- **Threshold guidance.** Documented "upgrade when X" signals (e.g., "MySQL tier no longer recommended above ~500k indexed obs", "Lucene tier no longer recommended beyond single-host throughput limits"). Numbers approximate but committed enough to act on.
- **Auto-recommend or alert?** Should the module surface an admin-visible warning when corpus size or latency crosses the threshold, or is detection purely an ops responsibility?
- **Coordinating tier upgrade with [Re-index / alias strategy](#re-index--alias-strategy).** Tier migration is a re-index, but the operational sequencing (when to dual-write, when to cut over, how long the rebuild takes) is shared with the alias open question and depends on its resolution.

### Name-refresh re-projection
[Decision 11](#decision-11-retired-metadata--data-references-preserved-names-snapshotted) accepts denormalized-name staleness as policy and names a full resource-type re-index as the remedy when freshness matters. That remedy is heavy: a full re-index of `querystore_obs` in any decent-sized site is millions of documents of embedding-generation cost, so in practice it is unlikely to be invoked routinely, and renames may sit unfixed for long periods. A lighter-weight path would be a **name-refresh re-projection**, triggered by a metadata-rename event: fan out across the documents that reference the renamed UUID and (1) re-render the document's text from its existing structured fields with the new name, (2) re-embed the new text, and (3) update the `*_name` field to match. This is *not* "re-embed only" — the text has to change too, because document text and embedding vector must remain consistent ([Decision 6](#decision-6-document-model--text-embeddings-and-structured-metadata)). The savings versus a full re-index come from (a) not re-fetching the underlying record from core (the obs / encounter / visit row hasn't changed; only the metadata it references did) and (b) scoping to documents that reference the renamed UUID rather than the entire resource type. For small-cardinality renames (a location, an encounter type, an obscure concept) the cost gap is orders of magnitude. Decision needed on: whether to build it (gate: whether the chartsearchai eval workflow exposes meaningful rename-driven recall degradation in practice), how to bound fan-out for large-cardinality renames (a popular concept rename can still touch millions of obs), and how it coordinates with the [Re-index / alias strategy](#re-index--alias-strategy) open question — strictly, name-refresh is a per-document partial update that does not require alias cutover, but it shares operational concerns (throughput, concurrent-event coordination, failure recovery) with the full re-index path and is best designed alongside it.

### PII and data-minimization scopes
The current document model stores full identifiers, names, addresses, and contact attributes in the `querystore_patient` index, plus provider names everywhere. Different consumers need different shapes of the same data: clinical-care callers need full patient identity; research-analytics callers typically need de-identified or pseudonymized projections. Decision needed on whether the read store maintains one fully-detailed projection with redaction applied at query time, multiple parallel projections at different sensitivity levels, or pushes minimization onto consumers entirely. Adjacent to but distinct from authorization (which governs *who can read*); this governs *what is stored and in what form*.

### Patient merge handling
When two patients are merged in core, all their clinical data is reassigned to the surviving UUID. The read store needs corresponding logic — at minimum, repointing every document keyed by the merged-away `patient_uuid`. Two sub-questions: (a) does core emit a patient-merge event under [Decision 12](#decision-12-sync-mechanism--events-first-aop-as-last-resort-gap-filler)'s sync model, or is this a gap to fill upstream or via scoped AOP, and (b) given a trigger, does the read store handle the merge as an in-place `patient_uuid` rewrite across every affected document, a delete + re-index of the merged-away patient's data, or another mechanism, including how the in-flight inconsistency window is handled.

### Concept-set and hierarchy queries
A query like "all glucose-related results" should match HbA1c, FPG, RBS, and other related concepts without enumerating every variant UUID at query time. OpenMRS has concept sets and concept hierarchies that could be denormalized into documents (e.g., a `concept_ancestor_uuids` array per obs). Decision needed on whether to support such queries directly in the index or to expand them at query time using a separate concept-relations service. A subset of the broader [Knowledge-base and reference-data projection](#knowledge-base-and-reference-data-projection) open question below.

### Knowledge-base and reference-data projection
[Decision 11 point 4](#decision-11-retired-metadata--data-references-preserved-names-snapshotted) puts direct metadata indices — `querystore_concepts`, `querystore_locations`, `querystore_drugs`, terminology mappings — out of v1 scope. The current model denormalizes `*_uuid + *_name` for these references into clinical-data documents but does not project the underlying knowledge base (concept dictionary, code systems, value sets, drug catalogue, location hierarchy, ConceptMap-style relationships) as queryable resources in their own right. This is a deliberate scope choice for v1, but the broader design surface — how knowledge base and instance data combine for retrieval — is currently implicit, split across that point, the [Concept-set and hierarchy queries](#concept-set-and-hierarchy-queries) open question above, and [Decision 13](#decision-13-module-extension-spi-service-provider-interface-for-custom-resource-types)'s SPI extension semantics. Surfacing it here so the position isn't only inferable. Decision needed on:

- **Which resources to project, if any.** Concepts (with definitions, mappings, set memberships, ancestors), value sets, code systems, drug references, location hierarchies, FHIR-shaped ConceptMap mappings — each has its own use-case justification and its own indexing cost.
- **Core querystore concern vs. SPI contribution.** Knowledge-base indices could be owned by querystore directly (consistent with the prefix convention) or pushed entirely to contributing modules via [Decision 13](#decision-13-module-extension-spi-service-provider-interface-for-custom-resource-types). The latter keeps querystore lean but means CIEL- or OCL-aware indexing requires a separate module; the former pulls a substantial domain into core scope.
- **Mixed retrieval semantics.** The `querystore_*` wildcard already makes mixed retrieval (instance data + knowledge base) syntactically cheap, but ranking, relevance, and embedding-space coherence across structurally different document types (clinical events vs. concept definitions) is not yet thought through. Co-mingling them in a single kNN result set may produce nonsensical orderings without per-type weighting.
- **Relationship to upstream terminology services.** Most OpenMRS deployments use CIEL or OCL/OCL-Online for their dictionary, and FHIR provides standard CodeSystem / ValueSet / ConceptMap shapes. Decision needed on whether querystore re-projects a local snapshot of these (subject to the same staleness concerns as Decision 11) or proxies live to the terminology service. The latter avoids divergence but couples query latency to an external service.

**Recommended default: delegate dictionary lookups to OCL / FHIR terminology operations** (`$lookup` for definitions and designations, `$translate` for cross-system mappings, `$expand` for value-set members) rather than re-projecting the dictionary into querystore. Querystore documents already carry `concept_uuid` per [Decision 9](#decision-9-coded-fields--store-both-uuid-and-name), which is the crosswalk key between clinical retrieval and dictionary lookup. Re-implementing synonym/locale/mapping search inside querystore duplicates work OCL already does centrally for every deployment and shifts the cost of embedding ~50K+ concepts onto each install plus every CIEL refresh.

The deployment-specific residual that OCL cannot answer reduces to four cases:

1. The CIEL subset this deployment actually loaded — "concepts in *our* dictionary" rather than "concepts anywhere in CIEL."
2. Local custom concepts not present in CIEL/OCL upstream.
3. Concepts intersected with this deployment's clinical data ("concepts with at least one obs against them here") — a join between dictionary and data only this deployment can resolve.
4. Co-mingled embedding-space retrieval that ranks dictionary entries alongside obs/encounters/orders in a single semantic query.

Items 1–3 are largely answerable with SQL against `concept` filtered to deployment scope; they do not by themselves require an index. Only item 4 requires concept content co-located with clinical data in the same embedding space, and that is the case the **Mixed retrieval semantics** bullet above flags as unresolved (ranking coherence across structurally different document types). Re-opening this open question for projection in querystore therefore reduces to demonstrating a consumer use case that item 4 serves and that UUID-crosswalk to OCL/FHIR does not.

Out-of-v1 by design; the gating signal for re-opening this is whether the chartsearchai eval workflow surfaces queries that need knowledge-base projections to answer well, or whether downstream consumers (FHIR analytics, AI agents reasoning over coded data) request it concretely.

### Timestamp time-zone convention
Documents mix date-only fields (`record_date`, `birthdate`) with timestamp fields (`start_date_time`, `end_date_time`, `date_handed_over`). The time zone for timestamps is unspecified. UTC is the obvious default, but OpenMRS data often originates in deployment-local time and is stored without a zone offset. The convention needs to be explicit so consumers know how to interpret a value like `start_date_time = "2025-03-15T09:30:00"` and so date-range filters match consistently.

### Person vs Patient model
The `querystore_patient` index conflates Person attributes (name, gender, birthdate, addresses, attributes) with Patient attributes (identifiers). In OpenMRS core these are separate entities — a Person can exist without being a Patient (e.g., providers, relatives). The current flattening is appropriate for a read-side projection focused on patient queries, but should be made explicit so downstream consumers do not expect a `querystore_persons` resource type to also exist or look for non-patient Persons in this index.

### Drug-order non-coded drug handling
`DrugOrder` exposes `drugNonCoded` (a free-text drug name used when the clinician records a drug outside the dictionary), the order-side analog of `Condition.nonCoded` and `Diagnosis.nonCoded`. The Decision 6 drug-order example doc and the field-descriptions table do not mention it, and the v1 serializer drops drug orders whose display name resolves to empty — so a non-coded drug with no `concept` and no `Drug` becomes a skipped document. Decision needed on whether to add a third fallback to the display-name resolution chain (`drug.name → concept preferred name → trimmed drugNonCoded`), mirror Condition/Diagnosis by storing it on a `non_coded` (or order-specific `drug_non_coded`) metadata field, and whether `DrugOrder.brandName` / `dispenseAsWritten` deserve indexed surfaces of their own. The same question applies to `Order.orderReasonNonCoded` (the free-text variant of `orderReason`) which is similarly absent from v1.

### Prefixed-primary-concept `concept_class` projection
Two v1 serializers — Allergy (`allergen_*`) and Patient Program (`program_*`) — rename the primary-concept UUID/name fields with a domain prefix instead of using the generic `concept_*` shape. Both still populate the cross-cutting `synonyms` field from the underlying concept per [Decision 6's Synonyms convention](#synonyms-and-group-obs-convention). Every other document type with a primary coded concept (obs, condition, diagnosis, drug_order, medication_dispense, test_order) additionally surfaces `concept_class` via the shared `putConceptFields` helper. The two prefixed serializers omit `concept_class` — Allergy because `allergen_type` (DRUG/FOOD/ENVIRONMENT/OTHER) already covers the categorical role, Patient Program because the program concept's class adds little signal over the program name itself. Decision needed on whether to: (a) populate generic `concept_class` for consistency with sibling serializers (writing it to the generic field even though UUID/name use a domain prefix); (b) introduce domain-prefixed variants (`allergen_concept_class`, `program_concept_class`) so all primary-concept-derived fields share a prefix per document type; or (c) ratify the v1 omission as intentional and document in the field-descriptions table that `concept_class` is not populated for prefixed-primary types. Affects any future wrapped- or metadata-wrapped primary type added under [Decision 13](#decision-13-module-extension-spi-service-provider-interface-for-custom-resource-types).

### Multi-workflow current state projection for Patient Program
A `PatientProgram` can have multiple workflows ([`ProgramWorkflow`](https://openmrs.atlassian.net/wiki/x/EYAJAQ)) running in parallel — e.g., an HIV program with a treatment workflow, a DSD model workflow, and a retention workflow — each with its own current state at a given moment. The Decision 6 `querystore_program` example surfaces a single `current_state_uuid` / `current_state` pair, which works cleanly for the common single-workflow case but cannot represent a multi-workflow snapshot. The v1 serializer picks the latest-started current state (ties broken by `patientStateId`) when multiple are active, which deterministically projects a multi-workflow program to one state but loses the others. Decision needed on whether to: (a) ratify the latest-started simplification as v1 behavior, accepting that multi-workflow programs are under-represented; (b) replace `current_state_uuid` / `current_state` with `current_states` (an array of `{workflow_uuid, workflow_name, state_uuid, state_name}` objects) so each workflow's current state is filterable independently; or (c) emit one document per (PatientProgram, workflow) pair so the resource_uuid is unique per workflow and existing single-state queries work without schema change. Option (b) is the smallest schema change but breaks the "scalar coded field" convention for `current_state_uuid`; option (c) preserves the scalar convention but multiplies document counts and changes the resource_uuid semantics. Affects retrieval quality for any deployment using multi-workflow programs (TB cohort tracking, NCD chronic-care pathways).

### ServiceOrder frequency / numberOfRepeats / location surfacing
`ServiceOrder` (parent of `TestOrder` and `ReferralOrder`) declares three fields beyond what the v1 serializers surface: `frequency` (`OrderFrequency` — repeat schedule), `numberOfRepeats` (`Integer` — bounded repeat count), and `location` (`Concept` — the service-performance location, *distinct* from the encounter's `Location` already captured by `putEncounterContext`). The v1 serializer ignores all three. The gap was inherited from the original TestOrder implementation and codified across both subtypes when populate logic was promoted to `AbstractServiceOrderRecordSerializer` (rule-of-two promotion). The miss is more visible for referrals than for lab tests: a referral expressing "weekly cardiology visits for 6 weeks at Karen Hospital" loses the cadence (`frequency`/`numberOfRepeats`) and the destination (`ServiceOrder.location`) in the projected document. Decision needed on whether to: (a) surface `frequency_uuid` / `frequency` + `number_of_repeats` + `service_location_uuid` / `service_location_name` for both subtypes (consistent with `drug_order`'s frequency treatment); (b) surface them only for `referral_order` where the clinical use case is strongest, leaving `test_order` unchanged; or (c) ratify the omission as out-of-scope for v1 and document the gap in the field-descriptions table. Affects retrieval quality for repeat-scheduled lab orders and any referral query touching cadence or destination. Surfacing is additive — pure serializer change plus a one-time re-projection per [Decision 1](#decision-1-cqrs-pattern--separate-read-store-from-transactional-database).
