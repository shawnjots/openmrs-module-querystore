# Query Store REST API

The query store's primary consumer surface is the in-process Java service
(`QueryStoreService`); see [ADR Decision 14](./adr.md#decision-14-authorization-and-consumer-api-surface).
These REST endpoints are **operational tooling, not the query surface** — an *observability* read
(is this deployment fully indexed?) and *administrative maintenance* triggers (re-index one patient,
or kick off the full backfill, without a restart). They exist because a deployment seeded by a SQL
dump bypasses the live indexing bridge and depends on the background bootstrap completing, and that
completion was otherwise unobservable and unrepairable on a live instance.

All endpoints are served under the OpenMRS REST namespace (the module requires the
`webservices.rest` module):

```
/ws/rest/v1/querystore/...
```

## GET `/ws/rest/v1/querystore/indexingstatus`

Returns the per-resource-type bootstrap (initial-backfill) status, plus a single derived
`complete` flag answering **"is this deployment fully indexed?"**.

- **Privilege:** `Get Patients` — a `failureMessage` can contain internal record/patient
  identifiers, so it is gated like the query store's read API.
- **Request body:** none.

**Response `200`:**

```json
{
  "complete": false,
  "types": [
    {
      "resourceType": "obs",
      "status": "RUNNING",
      "documentsIndexed": 320795,
      "cursorDateChanged": "2006-05-25T12:41:31Z",
      "startedAt": "2026-05-30T19:35:29.849Z",
      "completedAt": null,
      "failureMessage": null,
      "backend": "lucene"
    },
    {
      "resourceType": "diagnosis",
      "status": "FAILED",
      "documentsIndexed": 0,
      "cursorDateChanged": null,
      "startedAt": "2026-05-29T13:31:01.404Z",
      "completedAt": null,
      "failureMessage": "FetchNotFoundException: Entity `org.openmrs.Patient` with identifier value `49` does not exist",
      "backend": "lucene"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `complete` | `true` **only** when at least one type is tracked **and every** tracked type is `COMPLETED`. Any `RUNNING`/`FAILED`/`NOT_STARTED` type — or an empty progress table — yields `false`. This is the headline "fully indexed?" answer. |
| `types[].status` | `NOT_STARTED` \| `RUNNING` \| `COMPLETED` \| `FAILED`. |
| `types[].documentsIndexed` | Documents written for that type so far. |
| `types[].cursorDateChanged` | The backfill resume cursor (ascending `dateChanged`); records changed after this are not yet indexed. ISO-8601, or `null`. |
| `types[].startedAt` / `completedAt` | ISO-8601 timestamps, or `null`. |
| `types[].failureMessage` | Populated when `status` is `FAILED` (e.g. an orphaned row referencing a deleted patient). |
| `types[].backend` | The backend that row was written against (`lucene` \| `mysql` \| `elasticsearch`). |

## POST `/ws/rest/v1/querystore/reindex`

Re-indexes the read store in one of two scopes, selected by the request body. Both are destructive,
expensive maintenance operations gated by **`Manage Global Properties`** (stricter than the read
endpoint's `Get Patients`).

### Per-patient — `{"patient": "<uuid>"}`

Forces a full re-projection of **one patient** — deletes that patient's read-store documents and
re-indexes every resource type from core — then reports the resulting document count. This is the
only no-restart way to repair a **partially-indexed** patient (e.g. one whose recent records
arrived via a SQL dump): the lazy cold-touch projection refuses such patients because they already
have *some* documents.

- **Synchronous:** runs in the request thread; latency scales with the patient's record count
  (each record is re-embedded). Bounded to one patient.

**Response `200`:**

```json
{ "patient": "dd9836d7-1691-11df-97a5-7038c432aabf", "documentsIndexed": 154 }
```

```bash
curl -s -X POST -u admin:Admin123 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"patient":"dd9836d7-1691-11df-97a5-7038c432aabf"}' \
  https://your-server/openmrs/ws/rest/v1/querystore/reindex
```

### Global — `{"scope": "all"}`

Launches the **full backfill** over every patient and resource type — the same scan the
`querystore.bootstrap.autostart` startup path runs — on a daemon thread, and returns immediately.
This is the no-restart way to kick off (or resume) the global bootstrap on a live, already-running
instance; previously it could only start at module startup. Poll
[`GET /indexingstatus`](#get-wsrestv1querystoreindexingstatus) until `complete` is `true`.

- **Asynchronous:** a full-corpus scan can't run in a request thread, so the call returns `202
  Accepted` and the work proceeds in the background. Overlapping `scope:"all"` requests collapse to
  a single in-flight run via an in-flight guard in the launcher; even if two runs did overlap, the
  per-resource-type locks keep the progress bookkeeping safe.
- **Opt-in by design:** the global scope is requested *explicitly* with `scope:"all"` (matched
  case-insensitively), never by omitting `patient` — an absent field overlaps with a malformed
  request, and the global scan is the most expensive operation in the module.

**Response `202`:**

```json
{ "accepted": true }
```

```bash
curl -s -X POST -u admin:Admin123 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"scope":"all"}' \
  https://your-server/openmrs/ws/rest/v1/querystore/reindex
```

### Errors

| Status | Body | When |
|---|---|---|
| `400` | `{"error": "patient or scope:\"all\" is required"}` | neither `patient` nor `scope` supplied |
| `400` | `{"error": "Unknown scope '<x>'; the only supported scope is \"all\""}` | `scope` set to anything other than `all` |
| `400` | `{"error": "Specify either patient or scope:\"all\", not both"}` | both `patient` and `scope:"all"` supplied (ambiguous) |
| `503` | `{"error": "Cannot start reindex: the bootstrap daemon is not yet available"}` | `scope:"all"` requested while the module's daemon token is unavailable — normally a misconfiguration, since the token is wired during module startup, before the server serves requests |

**Semantics & caveats:**

- **Delete-before-reproject, under a per-patient lock** (per-patient scope). The delete and
  re-projection are atomic with respect to the lazy cold-touch projection (they share the same
  per-patient lock), so a concurrent first-touch can't interleave with the delete.
- **Transient partial reads** (per-patient scope). A concurrent search for the *same* patient may
  briefly observe partial or empty results while the rebuild is in flight (the read path's existence
  probe runs outside the lock). The full chart is restored by the time this call returns. Avoid
  triggering a reindex during active charting on that patient.
- **Concurrent bridge writes converge.** A live `saveObs` (etc.) during either scope's reindex is
  reconciled by the version-protection invariant (newer write wins, older dropped) — no corruption.
- **Single-type backfill.** To advance just one resource type in-process (e.g. retry a `FAILED`
  type after fixing its data), `BootstrapService.bootstrap(resourceType)` is available on the Java
  service; only the per-patient and `scope:"all"` triggers are exposed over REST.
